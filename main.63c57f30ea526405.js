Each time he played, he threw 4 red balls and 3 green balls at a target.","What was the total number of balls Hector threw at the target?"],AnswerChoices:{A:{Choice:"21",Key:{Correct:!1,Rationale:"The student likely added the numbers in the problem (14 + 4 + 3 = 21). The student needs to focus on understanding the mathematical operations (+, \u2212, \xd7, \xf7) needed to solve multi-step, real-world problems."}},B:{Choice:"68",Key:{Correct:!1,Rationale:"The student likely added the number of green balls thrown (3) to the number of games (14) to get 17 and then multiplied that sum by 4 (14 + 3 = 17; 17 \xd7 4 = 68). The student needs to focus on understanding the mathematical operations (+, \u2212, \xd7, \xf7) needed to solve multi-step, real-world problems."}},C:{Choice:"98",Key:{Correct:!0,Rationale:"To determine the total number of balls Hector threw at the target, the student could have added together the number of red balls (4) and the number of green balls (3) and then multiplied the number of games by the sum (4 + 3 = 7; 14 \xd7 7 = 98). This is an efficient way to solve the problem; however, other methods could be used to solve the problem correctly."}},D:{Choice:"46",Key:{Correct:!1,Rationale:"The student likely multiplied 14 by 3 and then added the 4 red balls (14 \xd7 3 = 42; 42 + 4 = 46).

The comparison is true because 17,090 has 5 digits and 2,984 has 4 digits, so 17,090 must be greater than (>) 2,984.

Since 34,162 has 5 digits and 3,986 only has 4 digits, 34,162 must be greater than 3,986. The symbol < in the given comparison indicates 34,162 is less than 3,986, which makes the comparison not true."}},H:{Choice:"16,538 > 15,981",Key:{Correct:!1,Rationale:"The student likely compared only the digit in the hundreds place (digit to the right of the comma) and determined that since 5 is less than 9, 16,538 is less than (<) 15,981.

Then the student should have compared the digits in the thousands place (second digits from the left) in 58,702 and 50,716 and determined that, since 8 is greater than 0, the number 58,702 is the greatest number and should come first in the list.
