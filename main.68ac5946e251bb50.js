The student likely then compared the digits in the ones place (rightmost digits) for 9,052 and 9,181, concluding that 9,052 should come second in the list. The student should have started comparing the digits in the thousands place (leftmost digits) for 9,052 and 9,181 and then used the same method to compare the digits in the hundreds place (second digits from the left). The student needs to focus on understanding how to order whole numbers from greatest to least value."}},B:{Choice:"6,912 \n 29,013 \n 34,987",Key:{Correct:!1,Rationale:"The student identified a list of numbers in order from least to greatest instead of from greatest to least as directed.

Since 58,702 and 50,716 both have five digits and 581 only has three digits, 581 must be the number with the least value, making its correct position in the list last. Next the student should have compared the digits in the ten-thousands place (leftmost digits) in 58,702 and 50,716 and determined that the digits represented the same value. Then the student should have compared the digits in the thousands place (second digits from the left) in 58,702 and 50,716 and determined that, since 8 is greater than 0, the number 58,702 is the greatest number and should come first in the list.
