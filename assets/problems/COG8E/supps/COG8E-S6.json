        ["1", "The Shakespearean authorship question has been a 20-year obsession for screenwriter John Orloff. His two-decade quest of researching and writing about it comes to an end with today's theatrical release of Anonymous, a costume drama¹ centered on that never-ending debate over who actually wrote Shakespeare's plays."],
        ["2", "The film adopts the “Oxfordian” theory, crediting Edward de Vere — the 17th Earl of Oxford and most frequently promoted alternate candidate — as the true author of the masterworks."],
        ["3", "Here, Orloff speaks about his interest in the subject."],

        ["4", "I was very tenuous² at first and unconvinced, as many people are. And then I kept on reading and reading and reading, and the more I read, the more convinced I became, and the more interested I became in all Elizabethan culture, not just Shakespeare's plays."],
        ["5", "I guess I sort of felt, I'll be honest with you, it was two pronged: On one hand [I felt] if Shakespeare didn't write the plays, what a tragedy it'd been that this other person wasn't recognized. But even more importantly, whether Shakespeare did write the plays or didn't write the plays, we're being taught a lot of bunk about William Shakespeare. I bristle when people teach me things and present them as facts when in fact they are not facts. That alone was enough to make me want to make this movie."],
        [" ", "𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿?"],
        ["6", "For me, you have to start off with the fact that there's no evidence he wrote the plays ... There's no first-hand documentary evidence. You start there. Then you go to the ability to write these plays, which we all know are so amazing and beautiful and filled with so many metaphors about so many things, like falconry and lawn bowling and tennis ... One has to make the leap that this young man from Stratford-upon-Avon, brilliant though he may have been, would have had [to have had] one heck of an education to write these things. And yet there's no record of him having attended any school, anywhere, ever."],
        ["7", "So, I follow Mark Twain³, who wrote a book about this issue [Is Shakespeare Dead?] and said, he, Mark Twain could never have written about the Mississippi had he not been a Mississippi riverboat pilot ... I happen to believe that Shakespeare didn't have the life to draw from to write about court intrigue, to write about the things I was just mentioning, the images that are filled through these plays. It just was not the life of a commoner."],

        ["8", "There's no Internet in 1600. He had no library. No books. There were no public libraries. You cannot write about 16th century law accurately because you're gifted. You can only do that because you understand 16th century law. I just don't believe the genius theory. It's different than music, where you only have to learn a certain amount of notes and then you go [and play or compose]. It's different with writing. That's why Walt Whitman, why Henry James, why James Joyce, why all of these writers in particular don't believe Shakespeare wrote the plays. They know what it is to write."],

        ["9", "I was fascinated by it, actually, that people take it so incredibly seriously. I'm sure those very same people loved the play Amadeus, which has absolutely no basis in fact whatsoever. Or maybe they love Shakespeare in Love. Clearly Judi Dench had no problem with the fantasy that is Shakespeare in Love. It's a lovely film but there's not one millisecond that has anything to do with historical accuracy."],
        ["10", "I don't know why Judi Dench had no issue being in that film; I guess because it glorified Shakespeare rather than not glorifying him. I think Simon Callow⁵ also had a rather upset reaction when we approached him. People get very upset about this. It's a mystery to me why they get so passionate about it above and beyond all other things."],

        ["11", "Certainly [it helps get people] talking about the film. We'll see about getting them to see it. I hope it does. They're pretty upset, particularly over in Britain. The whole county of Warwickshire, Shakespeare's birthplace, is really up in arms. They're protesting the movie quite loudly."],

        ["12", "Ultimately, Shakespeare himself was our guide. The Shakespeare histories are not really histories. They're dramas. He compresses time. He adds characters that have been dead by the time the events are occurring. He'll invent characters out of whole cloth, like [Sir John] Falstaff in the history plays. First and foremost it's a drama, and just like Shakespeare we're creating drama."]
