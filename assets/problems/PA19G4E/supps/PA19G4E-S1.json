While going to the docks I cried a great deal. Marry Ann, Ellie, and I were left by some coal there with nothing to do. We went in a little ship to the Scotia. We have nice staterooms and a gentleman showed us all round the ship. We started at 5. We 3 jumped around the deck and played. When we went to bed I was a little seasick."],

We drove on to Haden Hall, an old feudal castle of the 11th century. We saw the pewter¹ plates to cook and eat with. We saw the dining room and kitchen with its huge fire place and a bedroom with its bed in it and some tapestry. On this last was a picture of a boar hunt in which the dogs were in armor. The coat of arms was a bear and bull with shield. We drove on among wild and picturesque scenery to the New Bath hotel. We chased ducks there and found a dead gosling in the river. After a while took cars to Liverpool. Saw a huge oak."],

Coming back I had a goat wagon ride (great fun) and we then walked up to the old castle of Hastings. It was a mere ruin of the Saxon times but very, very much repaired and rebuilt by the Norman conqueror. We saw several pieces of iron things taken from the castle such as keys and melted iron. We had tea and then Papa went out for a walk and I put myself to bed all alone."],
