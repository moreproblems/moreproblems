Terrapins use their hind legs to dig a hole in the sand, deposit their eggs, and cover them up again to make a nest. Researchers following the same group of 1,200 female terrapins observed that the number of nests has dropped by 50% over the last 10 years."],
        [" ", "The loss of marshland in Jamaica Bay and increased pollution from human activities have led to high levels of nitrogen in the water. This increase in nitrogen promotes the growth of algae. The terrapins eat the algae instead of their normal diet of aquatic plants, snails, clams, and crabs. Algae is lower in protein and difficult for the terrapins to digest."],
