Since the garden is a rectangle, the right side of the carrots section has a length of 14 feet because it is the same length as the opposite side of the garden. The width of the carrots section is 30 - 24 feet, or 6 feet, because the width of the carrots section plus the width of the rest of the garden should add up to 30 feet, the same width as the entire garden. The student should have calculated that the area of the carrots section is (14 × 6) or 84 square feet because the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle."
