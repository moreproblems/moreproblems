        [" ", "\tIf you often find that it's hard to get everything done, you are in goodcompany. Many people sympathize. The idea that there is not enough time in the day is [something that is thought about negatively by many.] Fortunately, there are many techniques available to help individuals learn to organize their time. These [methods, which include effective tools for organizing work time and even social time, are] easily put into practice."],
        [" ", "\tFor work projects, you might experiment with setting small goals and timing yourself. To help with this, an Italian man invented the “Pomodoro Technique.” This technique [gets its name because in Italian “pomodoro” meant tomato, and Italians often will have had] kitchen timers in the shape of little tomatoes. However, you don't need a tomato timer to use this system. [You can determine a goal. You can set a timer for 20 minutes. You can try to complete one activity without interruption.]"],
        [" ", "\tEven if you use a timer, you still need to [select the right tasks] and goals. Planning ahead can help with that. For example, before you go on-line, decideexactly what you will do. You might decide to look up a definition first, then set acalendar date, and, finally, reply to two messages. Putting a little thought in beforehand will help you get the most from your free time."]
