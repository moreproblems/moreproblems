        [" ", "A Tennessee student studying the carbon cycle learned that carbon moves through all four spheres of Earth: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the biosphere, and the geosphere. The student wanted to understand how carbon cycles through both the abiotic and biotic parts of the planet."],

        [" ", "The student learned that the water (H₂O) in the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. This produces carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which easily splits apart into hydrogen ions (H⁺) and bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻), which are both charged particles. The chemical reaction for this process is shown."],

        [" ", "The bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) split into more hydrogen ions (H⁺) and carbonate ions (CO₃²). Corals and mollusks pull in seawater that contains the carbonate ions and calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and pump out any hydrogen ions. The organisms use the carbonate and calcium ions to make calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) for their skeletons and shells. The chemical reaction for this process is shown."],

        [" ", "When the corals and mollusks die, layers of their skeletons and shells form on the ocean floor. As the layers are buried by sediments, they compact and cement to form limestone, which is a sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)."]
