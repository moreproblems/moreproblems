Electric cars produce fewer emissions. They also release zero tailpipe emissions. Because electric cars are charged by power grids that burn fossil fuels, they are not necessarily zero-carbon. This means that the extent of the carbon footprint of an electric car depends on where the power to charge the vehicle comes from. Driving an electric car is the equivalent of driving a gasoline-powered car that gets 80 miles per gallon."]
