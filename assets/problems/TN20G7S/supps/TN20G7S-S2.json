The student found a diagram on the website that shows another way that carbon in the atmosphere is absorbed into another part of the planet. This diagram shows the carbon moving directly into the biosphere."],

During photosynthesis, plants make sugars that are used by the plant for growth and that are stored for energy. Animals eat the plants for food and absorb the carbon in the sugar. The chemical reaction for photosynthesis is shown."],

Eastern Tennessee has several coal mines that produce tons of coal each year. This coal is burned for energy, which releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere."]
