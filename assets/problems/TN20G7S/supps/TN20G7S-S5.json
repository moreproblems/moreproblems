        [" ", "All human life begins from a single cell. This cell then divides into many more cells. Cells in the human body divide through two main processes called mitosis and meiosis. The process of mitosis allows the human body to heal itself. New cells originate mostly from newer cell layers of a particular tissue. However, after an injury, older cells are pushed to an area to gradually fill in the damaged space. This complex process automatically stops once an injury is healed. The healing process is not just for injuries; the process also repairs normal wear and tear of the body. Skin, mouth, intestine, and blood cells that are damaged or dead are replaced daily."],
