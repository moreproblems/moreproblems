If a central angle of a unit circle in the xy-plane centered at the origin has its starting side on the positive x-axis and its terminal side intersects the circle at a point (x, y), then the value of the tangent of the central angle is equal to the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate. There are 2π radians in a circle. Dividing 92π/3 by 2π yields 92/6, which is equivalent to 15 + 2/3. It follows that on the unit circle centered at the origin in the xy-plane, the angle 92π/3 is the result of 15 revolutions from its starting side on the positive x-axis followed by a rotation through 2π/3 radians. Therefore, the angles 92π/3 and 2π/3 are coterminal angles and tan(92π/3) is equal to tan(2π/3). Since 2π/3 is greater than π/2 and less than π, it follows that the terminal side of the angle is in quadrant II and forms an angle of π/3, or 60°, with the negative x-axis. Therefore, the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle at the point (-1/2, √3/2). It follows that the value of tan(2π/3) is (√3/2)/(-1/2), which is equivalent to –√3.

It follows that when the value of x is either 7 or -3, the value of f(x) is 0. It’s also given that the function f is defined by f(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants. It follows that the function f is a quadratic function and, therefore, may be written in factored form as f(x) = a(x - u)(x - v), where the value of f(x) is 0 when x is either u or v. Since the value of f(x) is 0 when the value of x is either 7 or -3, and the value of f(x) is 0 when the value of x is either u or v, it follows that u and v are equal to 7 and -3. Substituting 7 for u and -3 for v in the equation f(x) = a(x - u)(x - v) yields f(x) = a(x - 7)(x - (-3)), or f(x) = a(x - 7)(x + 3). Distributing the right-hand side of this equation yields f(x) = a(x² - 7x + 3x -21), or f(x) = ax² - 4ax -21a. Since it’s given that f(x) = ax², it follows that b = -4a. Adding a to each side of this equation yields a + b = -3a. Since a + b = -3a, if a is an integer, the value of a + b must be a multiple of 3. If a is an integer greater than 1, it follows that a ≥ 2. Therefore, -3a ≤ -3(2). It follows that the value of a + b is less than or equal to -3(2), or -6. Of the given choices, only -6 is a multiple of 3 that’s less than or equal to -6.",

Substituting 7 - w for x in the given equation g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(7 - w - 2)(7 - w + 6)², which is equivalent to yields g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)². It’s given that the value of g(7 - w) is 0. Substituting 0 for g(7 - w) in the equation g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)² yields 0 = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)². Since the product of the three factors on the right-hand side of this equation is equal to 0, at least one of these three factors must be equal to 0. Therefore, the possible values of w can be found by setting each factor equal to 0. Setting the first factor equal to 0 yields 7 - w = 0. Adding w to both sides of this equation yields 7 = w. Therefore, 7 is one possible value of w. Setting the second factor equal to 0 yields 5 - w = 0. Adding w to both sides of this equation yields 5 = w. Therefore, 5 is a second possible value of w. Setting the third factor equal to 0 yields (13 - w)² = 0. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields 13 - w = 0. Adding w to both sides of this equation yields 13 = w. Therefore, 13 is a third possible value of w. Adding the three possible values of w yields 7 + 5 + 13, or 25. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of w is 25.",
