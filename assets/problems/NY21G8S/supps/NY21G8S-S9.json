        [" ", "\tA group of students did an experiment to measure the effect of water temperature on seed-germination time. The students planted the same number of two types of seeds in separate containers. Each container was made of clear plastic and had 50 milliliters (mL) of soil. For one week, bean seeds were watered once a day with 5 mL of hot (30° Celsius (°C)) water. Tomato seeds were watered once a day with 5 mL of cold (10°C) water. The time it took each type of seed to germinate was observed and recorded. The experimental setup is represented in the diagram below."],
