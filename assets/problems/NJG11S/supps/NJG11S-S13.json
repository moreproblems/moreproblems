Increased use of improved technologies, such as solvent extraction and electrowinning shown in Figure 1, has reduced the reliance on standard raw copper ore. These technologies are used in a process to extract copper from waste materials previously produced from traditional mining. The amount of waste available from previous mining makes the use of these technologies efficient for many years."],
