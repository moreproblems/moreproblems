Based on Table 1, the first significant change in the percentage of dark and light-colored moths in the population occurred in 1970; therefore, pollution-control laws would have to have been enacted prior to 1970. Because there was no significant change in the percentage of dark- and light-colored moths in the population between 1950 and 1960, the laws must have been enacted sometime in the 1960s.",
