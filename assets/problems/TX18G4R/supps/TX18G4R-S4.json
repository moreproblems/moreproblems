        ["1", "When people think of bees, they may also think of the sweet taste of the honey that bees make. However, some people may not know that bees help us in more ways than producing honey. Unfortunately, there aren’t as many honeybees today as there were a few years ago."],

        ["2", "When scientists realized that the honeybee population was declining, they tried to figure out why. They think there might be several reasons for this. They found that honeybees are not as healthy as they have been in the past. More honeybees are suffering from diseases and catching viruses from bugs. Scientists also learned that some areas where bees live have been turned into farms. The wildflowers and plants that bees feed on have been replaced with crops, which limits honeybees’ access to nectar and pollen. Another problem for honeybees may be the chemicals that are used to protect crops. The chemicals are sprayed on the crops, but they spread to other plants and flowers that bees depend on to survive."],

        ["3", "Many of the fruits and vegetables that humans and other animals eat cannot grow without the help of honeybees. Honeybees carry pollen among plants. The plants need pollen to grow and produce more seeds. Without the help of honeybees, we would not have as many of the plants we depend on for food."],

        ["4", "Bees pollinate a wide variety of plants in the United States. They pollinate fruit trees, vegetable plants, and crops such as clover and alfalfa, which feed cows and other farm animals. Many people may not realize it, but honeybees are important to every living thing."],
        ["", "Hᴏᴡ Hᴜᴍᴀɴs Cᴀɴ Hᴇʟᴘ"],
        ["5", "There are some things humans can do to help honeybees. People can grow flowers and plants that honeybees like, such as cabbage, sunflowers, and strawberries. People can also build beehives so that more bees will live in their area. In fact, some schools have initiated beekeeping programs to teach students about bees and to provide homes for bees that pollinate local plants."],
