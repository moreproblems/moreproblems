The base of the rectangle is 24 inches, and the height is 22 inches. For each circle, the diameter (straight line going through the center of a circle connecting two points on the circumference) is 6 inches. As a result, the radius (distance from the center to the circumference of a circle) of each circle is 3 inches, or half the length of the diameter. The student could have used the formulas for the area of a rectangle and for the area of a circle from the Area section of the STAAR Grade 7 Mathematics Reference Materials page within the student's test booklet (A = bh, where A = the area, b = the base, and h = the height of the rectangle, and A = πr², where A = the area and r = the radius of a circle). The student could have combined both formulas to find the shaded area, A = bh – 4(πr²), where 3 can be used as an estimate for π. So the area of the shaded region is A ≈ (24)(22) – 4(3 × 3²) ≈ 528 – 4(3 × 9) ≈ 528 – 4(27) ≈ 528 – 108 ≈ 420, or about 420 square inches.",
