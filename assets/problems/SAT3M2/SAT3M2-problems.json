It follows that the angles `/_RSO` and `/_ORS`, which are across from the sides of equal length, are congruent. Let `x°` represent the measure of `/_RSO`. It follows that the measure of `/_ORS` is also `x°`. It's given that the measure of `/_ROS` is `88°`. Because the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is `180°`, the equation `x°+x°+88°=180°`, or `2x+88=180` can be used to find the measure of `/_RSO`. Subtracting `88` from both sides of this equation yields `2x=92`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `2` yields `x = 46`. Therefore, the measure of `/_RSO`, in `text(degrees)`, is `46`.",

Applying the distributive property to the right-hand side of the given equation, `4x(x-7)`, yields `4x^2-28x`. Thus, the equation becomes `x^2+x-56=4x^2-28x`. Combining like terms on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation yields `0 = (4x^2-x^2)+(-28x-x)+56`, or `3x^2-29x+56=0`. For a quadratic equation in the form `ax^2+bx+c=0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants, the quadratic formula gives the solutions to the equation in the form `x=(-b+-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a)`. Substituting `3` for `a`, `-29` for `b`, and `56` for `c` from the equation `3x^2-29x+56=0` into the quadratic formula yields `x = (29+-sqrt((-29)^2-4(3)(56)))/(2(3))`, or `x=29/6+-13/6`.

Thus, the median of data set `A` is `13`, and the median of data set `B` is `13`. Therefore, statement I is true. Data set `A` and data set `B` have the same frequency for each of the values `11`, `12`, `14`, and `15`. Data set `A` has a frequency of `1` for values `10` and `16`, whereas data set `B` has a frequency of `2` for values `10` and `16`. Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a data set; it is larger when there are more values further from the mean, and smaller when there are more values closer to the mean. Since both distributions are symmetric with an odd number of values, the mean of each data set is equal to its median. Thus, each data set has a mean of `13`. Since more of the values in data set `A` are closer to `13` than data set `B`, it follows that data set `A` has a smaller standard deviation than data set `B`. Thus, statement II is false.

                    "Rationale": "It's given that the right triangle is isosceles. In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs have equal lengths, and the length of the hypotenuse is `sqrt(2)` times the length of one of the legs. Let `l` represent the length, in `text(inches)`, of each leg of the isosceles right triangle. It follows that the length of the hypotenuse is `lsqrt(2)text( inches)`. The perimeter of a figure is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the figure. Therefore, the perimeter of the isosceles right triangle is `l+l+lsqrt(2)text( inches)`. It's given that the perimeter of the triangle is `94+94sqrt(2)text( inches)`. It follows that `l+l+lsqrt(2)=94+94sqrt(2)`. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields `(1+1+sqrt(2))l=94+94sqrt(2)`, or `(2+sqrt(2))l=94+94sqrt(2)`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `2+2sqrt(2)` yields `l=(94+94sqrt(2))/(2+2sqrt(2))`. Rationalizing the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation by multiplying the right-hand side of the equation by `(2-2sqrt(2))/(2-2sqrt(2))` yields `l=((94+94sqrt(2))(2-2sqrt(2)))/((2+2sqrt(2))(2-2sqrt(2)))`. Applying the distributive property to the numerator and to the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation yields `l=(188-94sqrt(2)+188sqrt(2)-94sqrt(4))/(4-2sqrt(2)+2sqrt(2)-sqrt(4))`. This is equivalent to `l=(94sqrt(2))/1`, or `l=47sqrt(2)`. Therefore, the length, in `text(inches)`, of one leg of the isosceles right triangle is `47sqrt(2)`.",

Lines represented by equations in standard form, `Ax+By=C` and `Dx+Ey=F`, are parallel if the coefficients for `x` and `y` in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning `D/A=E/B`; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning `F/C` is not equal to `D/A` or `E/B`. The first equation in the given system is `3/2y-1/4x=2/3-3/2y`. Multiplying each side of this equation by `12` yields `18y-3x=8-18y`. Adding `18y` to each side of this equation yields `36y-3x=8`, or `-3x+36y=8`. The second equation in the given system is `1/2x+3/2=py+9/2`.

The proportion `6/8=1/(-3)` is not true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, `-1/3=-p/18`, by `-18` yields `p=6`. Therefore, if the system has no solution, then the value of `p` is `6`.",
