Adding 16t² to each side of this equation yields 16t² = 3,364. Dividing each side of this equation by 16 yields t² = 210.25.

                    "Rationale": "It’s given that angle Z in triangle XYZ is a right angle. Thus, side YZ is the leg opposite angle X and side XZ is the leg adjacent to angle X. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. It follows that tan(X) = YZ/XZ. It’s given that tan(X) = 12/35 and the length of side YZ is 24 units. Substituting 12/35 for X and 24 for YZ in the equation tan(X) = YZ/XZ yields 12/25 = 24/XZ. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 35(XZ) yields 12(XZ) = 24(35), or 12(XZ) = 840. Dividing both sides of this equation by 12 yields XZ = 70. The length XY can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if a right triangle has legs with lengths of a and b and a hypotenuse with length c, then a² + b² = c². Substituting for a and for b in this equation yields 70² + 24² = c², or 5,476 = c². Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields ±74 = c. Since the length of the hypotenuse must be positive, 74 = c. Therefore, the length of XY is 74 units. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all sides. Thus, (74 + 70 + 24) units, or 168 units, is the perimeter of triangle XYZ.",

Subtracting 6y from both sides of the equation x² + 14x + y² = 6y + 109 yields x² + 14x + y² - 6y = 109. By completing the square, this equation can be rewritten as (x² + 14x + (14/2)²) + (y² - 6y + (-6/2)²) = 109 + (14/2)² + (-6/2)². This equation can be rewritten as (x² + 14x + 49) + (y² - 6y + 9) = 109 + 49 + 9, or (x + 7)² + (y - 3)² = 167. Therefore, r² = 167. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields r = √167 and r = -√167. Since r is the length of the circle’s radius, r must be positive.

Substituting 1 for a, 8 for b, and k + 25 for c in b² - 4ac yields 8² - 4(1)(k + 2.5) < 0, or 64 - 4(k + 2.5). Since this value must be negative, 64 - 4(k + 2.5) < 0.
