Adding 16t² to each side of this equation yields 16t² = 3,364. Dividing each side of this equation by 16 yields t^2 = 210.25. Since the object will hit the ground at a positive number of seconds after it's dropped, the value of t can be found by taking the positive square root of each side of this equation, which yields t = 14.50.

The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. It follows that tan(X) = YZ/XZ. It's given that tan(X) = 12/35 and the length of side YZ is 24 units. Substituting 12/35 for X and 24 for YZ in the equation tan(X) = YZ/XZ yields 12/25 = 24/XZ. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 35(XZ) yields 12(XZ) = 24(35), or 12(XZ) = 840. Dividing both sides of this equation by 12 yields XZ = 70. The length XY can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if a right triangle has legs with lengths of a and b and a hypotenuse with length c, then `a^2+b^2=c^2`. Substituting for a and for b in this equation yields 70^2 + 24^2 = c², or 5,476 = c². Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields ±74 = c. Since the length of the hypotenuse must be positive, 74 = c. Therefore, the length of XY is 74 units. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all sides. Thus, (74 + 70 + 24) units, or 168 units, is the perimeter of triangle XYZ.",

Subtracting 6y from both sides of the equation x^2+ 14x + y^2= 6y + 109 yields x^2+ 14x + y^2- 6y = 109. By completing the square, this equation can be rewritten as (x^2+ 14x + (14/2)^2) + (y^2- 6y + (-6/2)^2) = 109 + (14/2)^2 + (-6/2)^2. This equation can be rewritten as (x^2+ 14x + 49) + (y^2- 6y + 9) = 109 + 49 + 9, or (x + 7)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 167. Therefore, r² = 167.
