                    "Rationale": "Functions f and g are both exponential functions with a base of 0.40. Since 0.40 is less than 1 , functions f and g are both decreasing exponential functions. This means that f(x) and g(x) decrease as x increases. Since f(x) and g(x) decrease as x increases, the maximum value of each function occurs at the least value of x for which the function is defined. It's given that functions f and g are defined for x ≥ 0. Therefore, the maximum value of each function occurs at x = 0. Substituting 0 for x in the equation defining f yields  f(x) = 33(0.4)⁰⁺³, which is equivalent to f(x) = 33(0.4)³, or f(0) = 2.112. Therefore, the maximum value of f is 2.112. Since the equation f(x) = 33(0.4)ˣ⁺³ doesn't display the value 2.112, the equation defining f doesn't display the maximum value of f . Substituting 0 for x in the equation defining g yields g(0) = 33(0.16)(0.4)⁰⁻², which can be rewritten as g(0) = 33(0.16)(1/0.4²), or g(0) = 33(0.16)(1/0.16), which is equivalent to g(0) = 33. Therefore, the maximum value of g is 33. Since the equation g(x) = 33(0.16)(0.4)ˣ⁻² displays the value 33, the equation defining g displays the maximum value of g. Thus, only equation II displays, as a constant or coefficient, the maximum value of the function it defines.",
