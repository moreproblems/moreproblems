During the French Revolution, he and his father spent time in prison. Once they were freed, they moved to America and settled in Delaware. Du Pont learned that gunpowder made in America often did not work, and he could use his knowledge to make better gunpowder. He built a factory on Brandywine Creek and sold his first gunpowder in 1804. Eventually, his company became one of the most successful in the United States.",
