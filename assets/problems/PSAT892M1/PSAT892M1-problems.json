It's also given that each nerite snail costs $6, and that Naomi bought 2 nerite snails. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, of the nerite snails that Naomi bought is 6(2), or 12. Since Naomi bought both the rabbit snails and the nerite snails for a total of $52, the equation 8x + 12 = 52 can be used to represent the situation. Subtracting 12 from both sides of this equation yields 8x = 40. Dividing both sides of this equation by 8 yields x = 5. Therefore, Naomi bought 5 rabbit snails.",

Subtracting 3/5 from both sides of this equation yields 3y/4 = 32/5. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 4/3 yields y = 128/15. Therefore, when x = 1, the corresponding value of y for the given equation is 128/15. Substituting 2 for x in the given equation yields (3/5)(2) + 3y/4 = 7, or 6/5 + 3y/4 = 35/5. Subtracting 6/5 from both sides of this equation yields 3y/4 = 29/5. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 4/3 yields y = 116/15.

Subtracting 12/5 from both sides of this equation yields 3y/4 = 23/5. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 4/3 yields y = 92/15.

The table in this choice gives x-values of 1, 2, and 4 and corresponding y-values of 128/15, 116/15, and 92/15, respectively. Therefore, the table in this choice gives three values of x and their corresponding values of y for the given equation.",

The segment shown has endpoints at (–6, 4) and (3, 10). Substituting (–6, 4) and (3, 10) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in the distance formula yields √(3 – (–6)² + (10 – 4)²), or √(9² + 6²), which is equivalent to √(81 + 36), or √117. Let x represent the length, in units, of the other leg of this triangle. The area, A, of a right triangle can be calculated using the formula A = bh/2, where b and h are the lengths of the legs of the triangle. It's given that the area of the triangle is 36√13 square units. Substituting 36√13 for A, √117 for b, and x for h in the formula A = bh/2 yields 36√13 = (√117)(x)/2. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 yields 72√13 = x√117. Dividing both sides of this equation by √117 yields 72√13/√117 = x. Multiplying the numerator and denominator on the left-hand side of this equation by √117 yields 72√1,521/117 = x, or 72(39)/117 = x, which is equivalent to 2,808/117 = x, or 24 = x.

                    "Rationale": "Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation x² + 6x + 7 = 0 yields x² + 6x = -7. To complete the square, adding (6/2)², or 3², to both sides of this equation yields x² + 6x + 3² = -7 + 3², or (x + 3)² = 2. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields x + 3 = ±√2. Subtracting 3 from both sides of this equation yields x = -3 ± √2. Therefore, the solutions r and s to the equation x² + 6x + 7 = 0 are -3 - √2 and -3 + √2. Since r < s, it follows that r = -3 - √2 and s = -3 + √2. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation x² + 8x + 8 = 0 yields x² + 8x = -8. To complete the square, adding (8/2)², or 4², to both sides of this equation yields x² + 8x + 4² = -8 + 4², or (x + 4)² = 8. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields x + 4 = ±√8, or x + 4 = ±2√2. Subtracting 4 from both sides of this equation yields x = -4 ± 2√2. Therefore, the solutions t and u to the equation x² + 8x + 8 = 0 are -4 - 2√2 and -4 + 2√2. Since t < u, it follows that t = -4 - 2√2and u = -4 + 2√2. It's given that the solutions to x² + 14x + c = 0, where c is a constant, are r + t and s + u. It follows that this equation can be written as (x – (r + t))(x – (s + u)) = 0, which is equivalent to x² – (r + t + s + u)x + (r + t)(s + u) = 0. Therefore, the value of c is (r + t)(s + u). Substituting –3 – √2 for r, –4 – 2√2 for t, –3 + √2 for s, and –4 + 2√2 for u in this equation yields ((–3 – √2) + (–4 – 2√2))((–3 + √2) + (–4 + 2√2)), which is equivalent to (–7 – 3√2)(–7 + 3√2), or (–7)(–7) – (3√2)(3√2), which is equivalent to 49 – 18, or 31. Therefore, the value of c is 31.",
