                    "Rationale": "A linear model can be written in the form `y=mx+b`, where `m` is the slope of the graph of the model in the `text(xy)`-plane and `(0,b)` is the `text(y)`-intercept. The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points `(1,3)` and `(9,10)` in the `text(xy)`-plane. Two points on a line, `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, `m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)`. Substituting the points `(1,3)` and `(9,10)` for `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, respectively, in the slope formula yields `m=(10-3)/(9-1)`, or `m=0.875`. Therefore, the value of `m` for an appropriate linear model is approximately `0.875`. Substituting `0.875` for `m` in `y=mx+b` yields `y=0.875x+b`. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point `(1,3)`, the approximate value of `b` can be found by substituting `1` for `x` and `3` for `y` in the equation `y=0.875x+b`, which yields `3=(0.875)(1)+b`, or `3=0.875+b`. Subtracting `0.875` from both sides of this equation yields `2.125=b`. Therefore, the value of `b` for an appropriate linear model is approximately `2.125`. Thus, of the given choices, `y=0.9x+2.2` is the most appropriate linear model for this relationship.\n\nAlternate approach: A linear model can be written in the form `y=mx+b` where `m` is the slope of the graph of the model in the `text(xy)`-plane and `(0,b)` is the `text(y)`-intercept. The scatterplot shows that as the `text(x)`-values of the data points increase, the `text(y)`-values of the data points increase, which means the graph of an appropriate linear model has a positive slope. Of the given choices, `y=0.9x+2.2` is the only linear model whose graph has a positive slope.",

If the value of the discriminant is positive, then the quadratic equation has exactly two distinct real solutions. If the value of the discriminant is equal to zero, then the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution. If the value of the discriminant is negative, then the quadratic equation has zero real solutions. In the given equation, `x^2-12x+27=0`, `a=1`, `b=-12`, and `c=27`. Substituting these values for `a`, `b`, and `c` in `b^2-4ac` yields `(-12)^2-4(1)(27)`, or `36`. Since the value of its discriminant is positive, the given equation has exactly two distinct real solutions.",

The slope of a line between any two points `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)` on the line can be calculated using the slope formula `m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)`. Based on the table, the graph contains the points `(-18,-48)` and `(7,52)`. Substituting `(-18,-48)` and `(7,52)` for `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, respectively, in the slope formula yields `m=(52-(-48))/(7-(-18))`, which is equivalent to `m=100/25`, or `m=4`. Substituting `4` for `m`, `-18` for `x`, and `-48` for `y` in the equation `y=mx+b` yields `-48=4(-18)+b`, or `-48=-72+b`. Adding `72` to both sides of this equation yields `24=b`. Therefore, `m=4` and `b=24`. Substituting `4` for `m` and `24` for `b` in the equation `y=mx+b` yields `y=4x+24`. Thus, the equation `y=4x+24` represents the linear relationship between `x` and `y`. It's also given that the graph of the linear equation representing this relationship in the `text(xy)`-plane passes through the point `(1/7,a)`. Substituting `1/7` for `x` and `a` for `y` in the equation `y=4x+24` yields `a=4(1/7)+24`, which is equivalent to `a=4/7+168/7`, or `a=172/7`.",

This expression can be rewritten as `akx+bk-ax^2-bx`, or `-ax^2+(ak+b)x+bk`. Since this expression is equivalent to `-x^2+(1/29)nk`, it follows that `-a=-1`, `ak-b=0`, and `bk=(1/29)nk^2`.

Substituting `k` for `b` in the equation `bk=(1/29)nk^2` yields `k^2=(1/29)nk^2`. Since `k` is positive, dividing each side of this equation by `k^2` yields `1=(1/29)n`.

Adding `x` to both sides of the equation `(sqrt(n/29))k-x=k-x` yields `(sqrt(n/29))k=k`. Since `k` is positive, dividing both sides of this equation by `k` yields `sqrt(n/29)=1`.

It's given that `bar(LM)` is parallel to `bar(PQ)`. The figure also shows that `bar(LQ)` intersects `bar(LM)` and `bar(PQ)`. If two parallel segments are intersected by a third segment, alternate interior angles are congruent. Thus, alternate interior angles `MLR` and `PQR` are congruent. Since triangles `LMR` and `PQR` have two pairs of congruent angles, the triangles are similar. Sides `bar(LR)` and `bar(MR)` in triangle `LMR` correspond to sides `bar(RQ)` and `bar(RP)`, respectively, in triangle `PQR`. Since the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional, it follows that `(RQ)/(LR)=(RP)/(MR)`. It's given that the lengths of `bar(MR)`, `bar(LR)`, and `bar(RP)` are `6`, `7`, and `11`, respectively. Substituting `6` for `bar(MR)`, `7` for `bar(LR)`, and `11` for `bar(RP)` in the equation `(RQ)/(LR)=(RP)/(MR)` yields `(RQ)/7=11/6`. Multiplying each side of this equation by `7` yields `RQ=(11/6)(7)`, or `RQ=77/6`. It's given that `bar(LQ)` intersects `bar(MP)` at point `R`, so `LQ+LR+RQ`. Substituting `7` for `LR` and `77/6` for `RQ` in this equation yields `LQ=7+77/6`, or `LQ=119/6`. Therefore, the length of `bar(LQ)` is `119/6`.",

This is equivalent to `0=5(x+7)(3x-51-1)`, or `0=5(x+7)(3x-52)`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `5` yields `0=(x+7)(3x-52)`. Since a product of two factors is equal to `0` if and only if at least one of the factors is `0`, either `x+7=0` or `3x-52=0`. Subtracting `7` from both sides of the equation `x+7=0` yields `x=-7`. Adding `52` to both sides of the equation `3x-52=0` yields `3x=52`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `3` yields `x=52/3`. Therefore, the solutions to the given equation are `-7` and `52/3`. It follows that the sum of the solutions to the given equation is `-7+52/3`, which is equivalent to `-21/3+52/3`, or `31/3`.",
