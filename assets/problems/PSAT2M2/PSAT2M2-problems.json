The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points (1, 3) and (9, 10) in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Substituting the points (1, 3) and (9, 10) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in the slope formula yields m = (10 - 3)/(9 - 1), or m = 0.875. Therefore, the value of m for an appropriate linear model is approximately 0.875. Substituting 0.875 for m in y = mx + b = + yields y = 0.875x + b. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point (1, 3), the approximate value of b can be found by substituting 1 for x and 3 for y in the equation y = 0.875x + b, which yields 3 = (0.875)(1) + b, or 3 = 0.875 + b. Subtracting 0.875 from both sides of this equation yields 2.125 = b. Therefore, the value of b for an appropriate linear model is approximately 2.125. Thus, of the given choices, y = 0.9x + 2.2 is the most appropriate linear model for this relationship.\nAlternate approach: A linear model can be written in the form y = mx + b where m is the slope of the graph of the model in the xy-plane and (0, b) is the y-intercept. The scatterplot shows that as the x-values of the data points increase, the y-values of the data points increase, which means the graph of an appropriate linear model has a positive slope. Of the given choices, y = 0.9x + 2.2 is the only linear model whose graph has a positive slope.",

The slope of a line between any two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) on the line can be calculated using the slope formula m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Based on the table, the graph contains the points (-18, -48) and (7, 52). Substituting (-18, -48) and (7, 52) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in the slope formula yields m = (52 - (-48))/(7 - (-18)), which is equivalent to m = 100/25, or m = 4. Substituting 4 for m, -18 for x, and -48 for y in the equation y = mx + b yields -48 = 4(-18) + b, or -48 = -72 + b. Adding 72 to both sides of this equation yields 24 = b. Therefore, m = 4 and b = 24. Substituting 4 for m and 24 for b in the equation y = mx + b yields y = 4x + 24. Thus, the equation y = 4x + 24 represents the linear relationship between x and y. It’s also given that the graph of the linear equation representing this relationship in the xy-plane passes through the point (1/7, a). Substituting 1/7 for x and a for y in the equation y = 4x + 24 yields a = 4(1/7) + 24, which is equivalent to a = 4/7 + 168/7, or a = 172/7.",

This expression can be rewritten as akx + bk - ax² - bx, or -ax² + (ak + b)x + bk. Since this expression is equivalent to -x² + (1/29)nk, it follows that -a = -1, ak - b = 0, and bk = (1/29)nk². Dividing each side of the equation -a = -1 by -1 yields a = 1. Substituting 1 for a in the equation ak - b = 0 yields k - b = 0. Adding b to each side of this equation yields k = b. Substituting k for b in the equation bk = (1/29)nk² yields k² = (1/29)nk². Since k is positive, dividing each side of this equation by k² yields 1 = (1/29)n. Multiplying each side of this equation by 29 yields 29 = n.\nAlternate approach: The expression x² - y² can be written as (x - y)(x + y), which is a difference of two squares. It follows that (1/29)nk² – x² is equivalent to ((√(n/29))k - x)((√(n/29))k + x). It’s given that k - x is a factor of -x² + (1/29)nk², so the factor (√(n/29))k - x is equal to k - x. Adding x to both sides of the equation (√(n/29))k - x = k - x yields (√(n/29))k = k. Since k is positive, dividing both sides of this equation by k yields √(n/29) = 1. Squaring both sides of this equation yields n/29 = 1. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 29 yields n = 29.",

It’s given that LM is parallel to PQ. The figure also shows that LQ intersects LM and PQ. If two parallel segments are intersected by a third segment, alternate interior angles are congruent. Thus, alternate interior angles MLR and PQR are congruent. Since triangles LMR and PQR have two pairs of congruent angles, the triangles are similar. Sides LR and MR in triangle LMR correspond to sides RQ and RP, respectively, in triangle PQR. Since the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional, it follows that RQ/LR = RP/MR. It’s given that the lengths of MR, LR, and RP are 6, 7, and 11, respectively. Substituting 6 for MR, 7 for LR, and 11 for RP in the equation RQ/LR = RP/MR yields RQ/7 = 11/6. Multiplying each side of this equation by 7 yields RQ = (11/6)(7), or RQ = 77/6. It’s given that LQ intersects MP at point R, so LQ + LR + RQ. Substituting 7 for LR and 77/6 for RQ in this equation yields LQ = 7 + 77/6, or LQ = 119/6. Therefore, the length of LQ is 119/6.",

This is equivalent to 0 = 5(x + 7)(3x - 51 - 1), or 0 = 5(x + 7)(3x - 52). Dividing both sides of this equation by 5 yields 0 = (x + 7)(3x - 52). Since a product of two factors is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is 0, either x + 7 = 0 or 3x - 52 = 0. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation x + 7 = 0 yields x = -7. Adding 52 to both sides of the equation 3x - 52 = 0 yields 3x = 52. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields x = 52/3. Therefore, the solutions to the given equation are -7 and 52/3.
