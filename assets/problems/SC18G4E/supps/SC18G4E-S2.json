        [" ", "The final two students in the 2009 National Geographic Bee waited patiently for their next question. Alex Trebek, the long-time host of the popular television show Jeopardy!®, stood before them. After a pause, Trebek asked, “Timis County shares its name with a tributary of the Danube and is located in the western part of which European country?”"],
        [" ", "The two students wrote down different answers. But seventh-grader Eric Yang had written the correct answer: Romania. As a result, this student from Texas won the top prize that year. Yang took home a $25,000 college scholarship. Other prizes in the 2009 contest included a trip with a parent or guardian to the Galapagos Islands in South America."],

        [" ", "Many people have heard of the Scripps National Spelling Bee®. The National Geographic Bee—or “GeoBee,” as it is called—does not involve spelling. However, it is similar to Scripps in some ways. It encourages students to sharpen their memories and thinking skills. Participants make their way from a contest within their own schools all the way up to a statewide contest. State winners and their teachers then receive a free trip to Washington, D.C. There, each student competes for the top geography prize in the nation."],
        [" ", "The first GeoBee was held in 1989. Since then, millions of students in grades 4 through 8 have participated. About 10,000 schools in the nation take part in the contest! Students who attend homeschools are also eligible to participate in the bee."],

        [" ", "GeoBee winners come from many different backgrounds, but they all have one thing in common. They share a deep interest in people and places around the world. For example, South Carolina student Connor Fraley, who is from the town of Florence, was a state winner in the 2017 contest. Eighth-grader Fraley had always been curious. When he was younger, he used to make his own maps and enjoyed looking at globes."],
        [" ", "Going to the national GeoBee in Washington, D.C., was a true adventure for Fraley. Though he did not win, all his hard work and studying offered him a great chance to explore. “Being from a small town,” he says, “I do not go to big cities that often, and I had never been to D.C. It was so cool for me to see all the monuments I had seen in textbooks and on TV but never up close.”"],

        [" ", "2009 champion Eric Yang has been described as an enthusiastic reader of everything from history books to cookbooks. Yang admitted, though, that he hadn't known the answer to the final question right off the bat. “I just made an educated guess,” he explained."],
        [" ", "There may be something to Yang's method. The GeoBee website includes some sample questions. With each question is its correct answer and a strategy that students might use to arrive at that answer. Upon taking a closer look, students may find that clues to the answer are often built right into the question. (See the box below for some sample questions.)"],

They can look through study guides, take online quizzes, and play games. Plus, anyone who is interested in the GeoBee can download an online app called the GeoBee Challenge. Players answer questions and even take part in a Map Challenge Round. People of any age are welcome to use the GeoBee Challenge app!"],
