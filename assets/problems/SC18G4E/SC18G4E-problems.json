That means that we did not add anything to one of the dishes with an apple slice. After everything was ready, we took notes about the appearance of each piece of apple. Throughout the day, we came back to check on our experiment and took more notes on any changes we saw. I noticed that the control was the first piece of apple to turn brown. The piece of apple in the lemon juice had changed the least by the end of the day. Ms. Thompson told us that the acid in the lemon juice is what helped keep the apple from turning brown.
