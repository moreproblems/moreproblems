The student should then have understood that the statement “she gave away 5 stuffed animals per month” means that the rate of change (ratio of the change in y-values to the change in x-values) for this situation is –5, since the number of stuffed animals decreases by 5 animals each month.

To find the area of the parallelogram (A = bh, where b represents the length of the base of the parallelogram and h represents the height), the length of the base should be multiplied by the height. The length of the base is shown as 26 centimeters. To determine the height of the parallelogram, subtract the height of the trapezoid (16 centimeters) from the height of the composite figure (32 centimeters); 32 – 16 = 16. This gives the height of the parallelogram. Thus the area of the parallelogram is 26  ́ 16 = 416 square centimeters. Next, to find the area of the trapezoid (A = 1/2 • [b₁ + b₂] h, where b₁ and b₂ represent the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid and h represents the height), substitute b₁ = 26, b₂ = 40, and h = 16 into the area formula: A = 1/2 • (26 + 40)(16) = 1/2 • (66)(16) = 528 square centimeters.

Since the given ratio of mystery bags to spy novels is 3 to 6, a proportion to find p, the number of spy novels, in 1 mystery bag is 3/6 = 1/p. To find the value of p, the student could have multiplied 6 by 1, resulting in 6, and then divided 6 by 3, resulting in p = 2. Therefore, each mystery bag contains 2 spy novels. To determine the number of spy novels in 8 mystery bags, the student could have multiplied 8 by 2, resulting in 16. To determine the number of spy novels in 6 mystery bags, the student could have multiplied 6 by 2, resulting in 12. The student then could have subtracted the number of spy novels in 6 mystery bags from the number of spy novels in 8 mystery bags, resulting in 16 – 12 = 4.

To find the rate of change, the student could have used the ordered pairs (–1, –11) and (1, 1) from the table and calculated the change in y as 1 – (–11) = 12, and the change in x as 1 – (–1) = 2,resulting in the ratio 12/2 = 6. The student then could have calculated b, the y-value when x = 0, by recognizing that since the rate of change is 6, the value of y when x = 0 must be 6 units more than the value of y when x = –1: –11 + 6 = –5. Substituting 6 for m and –5 for b in the equation y = mx + b results in the equation y = 6x – 5.

The student should have also calculated the area of the rectangle by substituting b = 18 and h = 6 into the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = bh, where A represents the area of the rectangle, b represents the base of the rectangle, and h represents the height), resulting in A = 18(6) = 108 square feet. Lastly, since a square is also a rectangle, the student should have calculated the area of the square by using the same formula for area of a rectangle (A = bh), substituting the value 6 for b and h into the formula resulting in A = 6(6) = 36 square feet. The student should then have found the sum of the areas to find the total area of the sidewalk, resulting in A = 18 + 18 + 108 + 36 = 180 square feet."

The student should have substituted b = 12 and h = 10.4 into the formula for the area of a triangle (A = 1/2 • bh, where A represents the area of the triangle, b represents the base of the triangle, and h represents the height), resulting in A = 1/2 • (12)(10.4) = 62.4 square inches for each triangle shown in the net.

Next, the student should have found the total of the family’s monthly budget by adding all the items, obtaining 800 + 600 + 360 + 540 + 750 + 580 = 3,630. Since b represents the minimum annual income the family must earn, multiplying the monthly budget by 12 will determine the value of b: b = $3,630  ́ 12."
