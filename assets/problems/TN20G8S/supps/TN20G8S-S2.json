        [" ", "The student continued reading and discovered that motors are built on the concept of electromagnets. Motors are used in many of the items found in a home, such as electric toothbrushes, ceiling fans, and vacuum cleaners. Since motors use electromagnets, the student decided to build his own. The student constructed a model of a small motor using an electromagnet. The model will be tested to see if it works when a copper wire is attached to a battery."],
