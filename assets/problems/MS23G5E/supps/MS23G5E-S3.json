        ["1", "\tGo to a movie and what do you smell? Hot, buttered popcorn — the oldest snack in America. Even before Christopher Columbus reached the New World, native people had been munching on ma-hiz (the Indian name for corn) for more than 5,000 years."],
        ["2", "\tEuropean explorers saw Aztecs dressed in necklaces and ceremonial headdresses made of popcorn. Native Americans brought popcorn to peace negotiations with the English colonists as a token of goodwill."],
        ["3", "\tThe oldest popcorn ears are 5,600-year-old cobs found in Bat Cave, New Mexico. The first way of popping corn was by placing it on hot stones over a fire or by tossing it into the fire and letting it pop out. Imagine trying to catch your snack as it flies into the air, hot as a spark!"],
        ["4", "\tThe Winnebago tribe popped its popcorn right on the cob. The Iroquois placed popcorn in pottery with heated sand, which popped the kernels. Even today, the Papagos in Arizona pop popcorn in large clay ollas over a fire."],
        ["5", "\tWhat makes popcorn pop? A tiny drop of water is stored in each kernel. As the kernel gets hot, the water heats and builds up pressure. The hard outside surface resists the water pressure for as long as it can. When it finally gives way, the water further expands, causing the popcorn to explode. It's funny to think that one of our favorite foods is made by an explosion!"]
