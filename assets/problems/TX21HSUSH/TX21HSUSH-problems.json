Here we try our wings that ... we may calmly take our places and prove to the world that what it needed most was two heads in counsel as well as “two beside the hearth.” When that day comes, the nation shall no longer miss as now the influence of half its wisdom, more than half its purity and nearly all its gentleness, in courts of justice and halls of legislation. Then shall one code of morals—and that the highest—govern both men and women; then shall the Sabbath be respected, the rights of the poor be recognized, the liquor traffic banished, and the home protected from all its foes.\n\n—A Handbook for the World's White Ribboners, 1895",
