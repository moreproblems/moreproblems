What these examples have in common is that they store information, such as phone numbers, directions, and general knowledge, so that a person doesn't have to commit this information to memory. A written list of a user's passwords for different websites serves the same function as these examples. Although remembering a list of passwords for different websites is conceivable without a list, keeping such a list shifts the burden of storing readily memorable information away from the user because the list preserves the information in place of the user's memory. Therefore, based on the passage, a written list of a user's passwords for different websites would be considered a transactive memory source.",

In the last paragraph, she argues that women “cannot remain inactive” in confronting slavery as “our country is as dear to us as to the proudest statesman... Let our course, then, still be onward!” Therefore, Smith's main purpose in the passage is to encourage women to see their participation in the abolitionist cause as just and important.",

However, in the fourth paragraph, Smith returns to the political aspect of the argument at hand by addressing how women must engage in the subject of slavery on a political scale. She argues that “admitting [slavery] to be a political question” doesn't mean that women have “no interest in the welfare of our country,” as women must criticize slavery and its “unjust laws” and seek to stop the nation's “downward course” by choosing to not “remain inactive.” Therefore, Smith develops her argument about slavery as a “political question” over the course of the passage by dismissing the designation as too narrow but then demonstrates its relevance to her audience.",
