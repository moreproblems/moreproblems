                    "Rationale": "Multiplying each side of the given equation by -16 yields 64x² + 112x = 576. To complete the square, adding 49 to each side of this equation yields 64x² + 112x + 49 = 576 + 49, or (8x + 7)² = 625. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields two equations: 8x + 7 = 25 and 8x + 7 = -25. Subtracting 7 from each side of the equation 8x + 7 = 25 yields 8x = 18. Dividing each side of this equation by 8 yields x = 18/8, or x = 9/4. Therefore, 9/4 is a solution to the given equation. Subtracting 7 from each side of the equation 8x + 7 = -25 yields 8x = -32. Dividing each side of this equation by 8 yields x = -4. Therefore, the given equation has two solutions, 9/4 and -4. Since 9/4 is positive, it follows that 9/4 is the positive solution to the given equation. Alternate approach: Adding 4x² and 7x to each side of the given equation yields 0 = 4x² + 7x - 36. The right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten as 4x² + 16x - 9x - 36. Factoring out the common factor of 4x from the first two terms of this expression and the common factor of -9 from the second two terms yields 4x(x + 4) - 9(x + 4). Factoring out the common factor of (x + 4) from these two terms yields the expression (4x - 9)(x + 4). Since this expression is equal to 0, it follows that either 4x - 9 = 0 or x + 4 = 0. Adding 9 to each side of the equation 4x - 9 = 0 yields 4x = 9. Dividing each side of this equation by 4 yields x = 9/4. Therefore, 9/4 is a positive solution to the given equation. Subtracting 4 from each side of the equation x + 4 = 0 yields x = -4. Therefore, the given equation has two solutions, 9/4 and -4. Since 9/4 is positive, it follows that 9/4 is the positive solution to the given equation.",

It follows that the angle with measure x° and the angle with measure y° are vertical angles, so x = y. It's given that x = 6k + 13 and y = 8k - 29. Substituting 6k + 13 for x and 8k - 29 for y in the equation x = y yields 6k + 13 = 8k - 29. Subtracting 6k from both sides of this equation yields 13 = 2k - 29.

It's given that lines m and n are parallel, and the figure shows that lines m and n are intersected by a transversal, line t. If two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, then the same-side interior angles are supplementary.

                    "Rationale": "It's given that angle J is the right angle in triangle JKL. Therefore, the acute angles of triangle JKL are angle K and angle L. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite its right angle. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle JKL is side KL. The cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. It's given that cos(K) = 24/51. This can be written as cos(K) = 8/17. Since the cosine of angle K is a ratio, it follows that the length of the side adjacent to angle K is 8n and the length of the hypotenuse is 17n, where n is a constant. Therefore, JK = 8n and KL = 17n. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For triangle JKL, it follows that (JK)² + (JL)² = (KL)². Substituting 8n for JK and 17n for KL yields (8n)² + (JL)² = (17n)². This is equivalent to 64n² + (JL)² = 289n². Subtracting 64n² from each side of this equation yields (JL)² = 225n². Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields JL = 15n. Since cos(L) = JL/KL, it follows that cos(L) = 15n/17n, which can be rewritten as cos(L) = 15/17. Note that 15/17, 0.8824, 0.8823, and 0.882 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.",

It follows that if an ordered pair (x, y) is a solution to the system, the point (x, y) lies on the graph in the xy-plane of each equation in the system. The only point that lies on each graph of the system of two linear equations shown is their intersection point (8, 2). It follows that if a new graph of three linear equations is created using the system of equations shown and the graph of 4 16 x y + = -, this system has either zero solutions or one solution, the point (8, 2). Substituting 8 for x and 2 for y in the equation x + 4y = -16 yields 8 + 4(2) = -16, or 16 = -16. Since this equation is not true, the point (8, 2) does not lie on the graph of x + 4y = -16. Therefore, (8, 2) is not a solution to the system of three equations. It follows that there are zero solutions to this system.",

Shifting circle A down two units is a rigid vertical translation of circle A that does not change its size or shape. Since circle B is obtained by shifting circle A down two units, it follows that circle B has the same radius as circle A, and for each point (x, y) on circle A, the point (x, y - 2) lies on circle B. Moreover, if (h, k) is the center of circle A, then (h, k - 2) is the center of circle B. Therefore, circle B has a radius of 7 and the center of circle B is (0, 1 - 2), or (0, -1).

                    "Rationale": "Let x represent the side length, in cm, of each square base. If the two prisms are glued together along a square base, the resulting prism has a surface area equal to twice the surface area of one of the prisms, minus the area of the two square bases that are being glued together, which yields 2K - 2x² cm². It's given that this resulting surface area is equal to (92/47)K cm², so 2K - 2x² = (92/47)K. Subtracting (92/47)K from both sides of this equation yields 2K - (92/47)K - 2x² = 0. This equation can be rewritten by multiplying 2K on the left-hand side by 47/47, which yields (94/47)K - (92/47)K - 2x² = 0, or (2/47)K - 2x² = 0. Adding 2x² to both sides of this equation yields (2/47)K = 2x². Multiplying both sides of this equation by 47/2 yields K = 47x². The surface area K, in cm², of each rectangular prism is equivalent to the sum of the areas of the two square bases and the areas of the four lateral faces. Since the height of each rectangular prism is 90 cm and the side length of each square base is x cm, it follows that the area of each square base is x² cm² and the area of each lateral face is 90x cm². Therefore, the surface area of each rectangular prism can be represented by the expression 2x² + 4(90x), or 2x² + 360x. Substituting this expression for K in the equation K = 47x² yields 2x² + 360x = 47x². Subtracting 2x² and 360x from both sides of this equation yields 0 = 45x² - 360x. Factoring x from the right-hand side of this equation yields 0 = x(45x - 360). Applying the zero product property, it follows that x = 0 and 45x - 360 = 0. Adding 360 to both sides of the equation 45x - 360 = 0 yields 45x = 360. Dividing both sides of this equation by 45 yields x = 8. Since a side length of a rectangular prism can't be 0, the length of each square base is 8 cm.",
