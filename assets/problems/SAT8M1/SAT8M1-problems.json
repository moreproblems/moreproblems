Squaring both sides of √(2x + 6) = x – 1 yields 2x + 6 = x² − 2x + 1. This equation can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in standard form: x² – 4x – 5 = 0. One way to solve this quadratic equation is to factor the expression x² − 4x – 5 by identifying two numbers with a sum of –4 and a product of –5. These numbers are –5 and 1. So the quadratic equation can be factored as (x – 5)(x + 1) = 0. It follows that 5 and –1 are the solutions to the quadratic equation. However, the solutions must be verified by checking whether 5 and –1 satisfy the original equation, √(2x + 6) + 4 = x + 3. When x = –1, the original equation gives √(2(−1) + 6) + 4 = (−1) + 3, or 6 = 2, which is false. Therefore, –1 does not satisfy the original equation. When x = 5, the original equation gives √(2(5) + 6) + 4 = 5 + 3, or 8 = 8, which is true. Therefore, x = 5 is the only solution to the original equation, and so the solution set is {5}.",

According to the given equation, the center of the circle is (6, –5). Let (x₁, y₁) represent the coordinates of point Q. Since point P (10, –5) and point Q (x₁, y₁) are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center (6, –5) lies on the diameter, halfway between P and Q. Therefore, the following relationships hold: (x₁ + 10)/2 = 6 and (y₁ + (−5))/2 = −5. Solving the equations for x₁ and y₁, respectively, yields x₁ = 2 and y₁ = −5. Therefore, the coordinates of point Q are (2, –5).\nAlternate approach: Since point P (10, −5) on the circle and the center of the circle (6, −5) have the same y-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is 10 – 6 = 4.

It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, x + y = 60 and 2x + 4y = 202. The first equation can be rewritten as y = −x + 60. Substituting −x + 60 for y in the equation 2x + 4y = 202 yields 2x + 4(−x + 60) = 202. Distributing and combining like terms gives −2x + 240 = 202. Subtracting 240 from both sides of −2x + 240 = 202 and then dividing both sides by −2 gives x = 19. Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.\nAlternate approach: If each of the 60 tents held 4 people, the total number of people that could be accommodated in tents would be 240. However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents. Since each of these tents holds 2 people fewer than a 4-person tent, 38/2 = 19 gives the number of 2-person tents.",
