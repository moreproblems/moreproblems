                    "Rationale": "Let s represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let l represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It’s given that the owner pays $4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays 4.90s dollars for s small candles and 11.60l dollars for l large candles, which means the owner pays a total of 4.90s + 11.60l dollars to purchase candles. It’s given that the owner budgets $2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, 4.90s + 11.60l ≤ 2,200. It’s also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, s + l ≥ 200. The inequalities 4.90s + 11.60l ≤ 2,200 and s + l ≥ 200 can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting l from both sides of the inequality s + l ≥ 200 yields s ≥ 200 - l. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 4.90 yields 4.90s ≥ 4.90(200 - l), or 4.90s ≥ 980 - 4.90l. Adding 11.60l, to both sides of this inequality yields 4.90s + 11.60l ≥ 980 - 4.90l + 11.60l, or 4.90s + 11.60l ≥ 980 + 6.70l. This inequality can be combined with the inequality 4.90s + 11.60l ≤ 2,200, which yields the compound inequality 980 + 6.70l ≤ 4.90s + 11.60l ≤ 2,200. It follows that 980 + 6.70l ≤ 2,200. Subtracting 980 from both sides of this inequality yields 6.70l ≤ 1,220. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 6.70 yields approximately l ≤ 182.09. Since the  number of large candles the owner purchases must be a whole number, the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase is the largest whole number less than 182.09, which is 182.",

                    "Rationale": "The mean of a data set is the sum of the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set. The new data set consists of the weights of the 71 tortoises in the original data set and one additional weight, 39. Since the additional weight, 39, is greater than any of the values in the original data set, the mean of the new data set is greater than the mean of the original data set. If a data set contains an odd number of data values, the median is represented by the middle data value in the list when the data values are listed in ascending or descending order. Since the original data set consists of the weights of 71 tortoises and is in ascending order, the median of the original data set is represented by the middle value, or the 36th value. Based on the frequencies shown in the table, the 36th value in this data set is 17. If a data set contains an even number of data values, the median is between the two middle data values when the values are listed in ascending or descending order. Since the new data set consists of the weights of 72 tortoises, the median of the new data set is between the 36th and 37th data values when the values are arranged in ascending order. To keep the data in ascending order, the additional value of 39 would be placed at the bottom of the frequency table with a frequency of 1. Therefore, based on the frequencies in the table, the 36th and 37th values in the new data set are both 17. It follows that the median of the new data set is 17, which is the same as the median of the original data set. Therefore, the mean of the new data set is greater than the mean of the original data set, and the medians of the two data sets are equal.",

Since the two terms on the right-hand side of this equation have a common factor of (x − 29), it can be rewritten as 0  = (x − 29)(x − a + (-1)), or 0  = (x − 29)(x − a - 1). Since x - a - 1 is equivalent to x - (a + 1), the equation 0  = (x − 29)(x − a - 1) can be rewritten as 0 = (x - 29)(x - (a + 1)). By the zero product property, it follows that x - 29 = 0 or x - (a + 1) = 0. Adding 29 to both sides of the equation x - 29 = 0 yields x = 29. Adding a + 1 to both sides of the equation x - (a + 1) = 0h yields x = a + 1. Therefore, the two solutions to the given equation are 29 and a + 1.

For the function g, since the base of the exponent, 0.73, is less than 1, the value of (0.73)ˣ decreases as x increases. Therefore, the value of 9(0.73)ˣ also decreases as x increases. It follows that the maximum value of g(x) for x ≥ 0 occurs when x = 0. Substituting 0 for x in the function g yields g(0) = 9(0.73)⁰ which is equivalent to g(0) = 9(1), or g(0) = 9.

Right triangle AMO can be formed, where M is the midpoint of one of the triangle’s sides, A is one of this side’s endpoints, and O is the center of the circle. It follows that AM is 284/2, or 142, cm. Additionally, triangle AMO has angles measuring 60°, and 30°, 90°, where the measure of angle OMA is 90° and the measure of angle OAM is 30°. It follows that the length of side MO is half the length of hypotenuse AO, and the length of side AM is √3 times the length of side MO. It’s given that AO = w√3 cm. Therefore, MO = w√3/2 cm and AM = w(√3)(√3)/2 cm, which is equivalent to AM = 3w/2 cm. Since AM = 142 cm, it follows that 3w/2 = 142. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 yields 3w = 284.
