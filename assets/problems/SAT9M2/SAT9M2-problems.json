Therefore, the relationship between `t` and `n` can be represented by an increasing exponential equation of the form `n=a(1+b)^t`, where `a` and `b` are positive constants. The table shows that when `t=0`, `n=604`. Substituting `0` for `t` and `604` for `n` in the equation `n=a(1+b)^t` yields `n=a(1+b)^0`, which is equivalent to `604=a(1)`, or `604=a`. Substituting `604` for `a` in the equation `n=a(1+b)^t` yields `n=604(1+b)^t`. The table also shows that when `t=1`, `n=606.42`. Substituting `1` for `t` and `606.42` for `n` in the equation `n=604(1+b)^t` yields `606.42=604(1+b)^1`, or `606.42=604(1+b)`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `604` yields approximately `1.004=1+b`. Subtracting `1` from both sides of this equation yields that the value of `b` is approximately `0.004`. Substituting `0.004` for `b` in the equation `n=604(1+b)^t` yields `n=604(1+0.004)^t`. Therefore, of the choices, this choice best represents the relationship between `t` and `n`.",

It's given that a square is inscribed in a circle and the length of a radius of the circle is `(20sqrt(2))/2` `text(inches)`. Therefore, the length of a diameter of the circle is `2((20sqrt(2))/2)` `text(inches)`, or `20sqrt(2)` `text(inches)`. It follows that the length of a diagonal of the square is `20sqrt(2)` `text(inches)`. A diagonal of a square separates the square into two right triangles in which the legs are the sides of the square and the hypotenuse is a diagonal. Since a square has `4` congruent sides, each of these two right triangles has congruent legs and a hypotenuse of length `20sqrt(2)` `text(inches)`. Since each of these two right triangles has congruent legs, they are both `45`-`45`-`90` triangles. In a `45`-`45`-`90` triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is `sqrt(2)` times the length of a leg. Let `s` represent the length of a leg of one of these `45`-`45`-`90` triangles. It follows that `20sqrt(2)=sqrt(2)(s)`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `sqrt(2)` yields `20=x`. Therefore, the length of a leg of one of these `45`-`45`-`90` triangles is `20` `text(inches)`. Since the legs of these two `45`-`45`-`90` triangles are the sides of the square, it follows that the side length of the square is `20` `text(inches)`.",

Substituting `0` for `x` in the equation defining function `f` yields `f(0)=a(2.2^0+2.2^b)`, or `f(0)=a(1+2.2^b)`. So, the `y`-coordinate of the `y`-intercept of the graph is `a(1+2.2^b)`, or equivalently, `a+a(2.2^b)`. It's given that function `g` is equivalent to function `f`, where `0ltaltb`. It follows that `k=2.2^b`. Since `a(2.2^b)` can't be equal to `0`, the coefficient `a` can't be equal to `a+a(2.2^b)`. Since `0lta`, the constant `k`, which is equal to `2.2^b`, can't be equal to `a+a(2.2^b)`. Therefore, function `g` doesn't display the `y`-coordinate of the `y`-intercept of the graph of `y=f(x)` in the `xy`-plane as a constant or coefficient. It's also given that function `h` is equivalent to function `f`, where `0ltaltb`. The equation defining `f` can be rewritten as `f(x)=a(2.2)^x+a(2.2)^b`. It follows that `m=a(2.2)^b`. Since `a(2.2)^b` can't be equal to `0`, the coefficient `a` can't be equal to `a+a(2.2)^b`. Since `0lta`, the constant `m`, which is equal to `a(2.2)^b`, can't be equal to `a+a(2.2)^b`. Therefore, function `h` doesn't display the `y`-coordinate of the `y`-intercept of the graph of `y=f(x)` in the `xy`-plane as a constant or coefficient.

                    "Rationale": "An equation of the form `ax^2+bx+c=0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants, has no real solutions if and only if its discriminant, `b^2-4ac`, is negative. Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of the equation `x(kx-56)=-16` yields `kx^2- 56x=-16`. Adding `16` to each side of this equation yields `kx^2- 56x+16=0`. Substituting `k` for `a`, `-56` for `b`, and `16` for `c` in `b^2-4ac` yields a discriminant of `(-56)^2-4(k)(16)`, or `3,136-64k`. If the given equation has no real solution, it follows that the value of `3,136-64k` must be negative. Therefore, `3,136-64klt0`. Adding `64k` to both sides of this inequality yields `3,136lt64k`. Dividing both sides of this inequality by `64` yields k `49ltk`, or `kgt49`. Since it's given that `k` is an integer, the least possible value of `k` is `50`.",
