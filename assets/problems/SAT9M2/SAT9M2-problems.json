Therefore, the relationship between t and n can be represented by an increasing exponential equation of the form n = a(1 + b)ᵗ, where a and b are positive constants. The table shows that when t = 0, n = 604. Substituting 0 for t and 604 for n in the equation n = a(1 + b)ᵗ yields n = a(1 + b)⁰, which is equivalent to 604 = a(1), or 604 = a. Substituting 604 for a in the equation n = a(1 + b)ᵗ yields n = 604(1 + b)ᵗ. The table also shows that when t = 1, n = 606.42. Substituting 1 for t and 606.42 for n in the equation n = 604(1 + b)ᵗ yields 606.42 = 604(1 + b)¹, or 606.42 = 604(1 + b).

Since the graph has a `text(y)`-intercept at (0, -25), f(0) = -25. Substituting 0 for x in the given equation yields f(0) = a⁰ + b, or f(0) = 1 + b, and substituting -25 for f(0) in this equation yields -25 = 1 + b. Subtracting 1 from each side of this equation yields -26 = b. Substituting -26 for b in the equation f(x) = aˣ + b yields f(x) = aˣ - 26. Since the graph also passes through the point (2, 23), f(2) = 23. Substituting 2 for x in the equation f(x) = aˣ - 26 yields f(2) = a² - 26, and substituting 23 for f(2) yields 23 = a² - 26.

It's given that a square is inscribed in a circle and the length of a radius of the circle is 20√2/2 inches. Therefore, the length of a diameter of the circle is 2(20√2/2) inches, or 20√2 inches. It follows that the length of a diagonal of the square is 20√2 inches. A diagonal of a square separates the square into two right triangles in which the legs are the sides of the square and the hypotenuse is a diagonal. Since a square has 4 congruent sides, each of these two right triangles has congruent legs and a hypotenuse of length 20√2 inches. Since each of these two right triangles has congruent legs, they are both 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of a leg. Let s represent the length of a leg of one of these 45-45-90 triangles. It follows that 20√2 = √2(s). Dividing both sides of this equation by √2 yields 20 = x. Therefore, the length of a leg of one of these 45-45-90 triangles is 20 inches. Since the legs of these two 45-45-90 triangles are the sides of the square, it follows that the side length of the square is 20 inches.",

Substituting 0 for x in the equation defining function f yields f(0) = a(2.2⁰ + 2.2ᵇ), or f(0) = a(1 + 2.2ᵇ). So, the `text(y)`-coordinate of the `text(y)`-intercept of the graph is a(1 + 2.2ᵇ), or equivalently, a + a(2.2ᵇ). It's given that function g is equivalent to function f, where 0 < a < b. It follows that k = 2.2ᵇ. Since a(2.2ᵇ) can't be equal to 0, the coefficient a can't be equal to a + a(2.2ᵇ). Since 0 < a, the constant k, which is equal to 2.2ᵇ, can't be equal to a + a(2.2ᵇ). Therefore, function g doesn't display the `text(y)`-coordinate of the `text(y)`-intercept of the graph of `y=f(x)` in the `text(xy)`-plane as a constant or coefficient. It's also given that function h is equivalent to function f, where 0 < a < b. The equation defining f can be rewritten as f(x) = a(2.2)^x + a(2.2)ᵇ. It follows that m = a(2.2)ᵇ. Since a(2.2)ᵇ can't be equal to 0, the coefficient a can't be equal to a + a(2.2)ᵇ. Since 0 < a, the constant m, which is equal to a(2.2)ᵇ, can't be equal to a + a(2.2)ᵇ. Therefore, function h doesn't display the `text(y)`-coordinate of the `text(y)`-intercept of the graph of `y=f(x)` in the `text(xy)`-plane as a constant or coefficient.
