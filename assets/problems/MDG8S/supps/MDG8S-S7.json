The student placed one insulated cup into another insulated cup, poured 30 milliliters (mL) of water at 20 degrees Celsius into the inner cup, and covered the cup. Finally, a hole was made in the cover and a thermometer was placed in the hole. The student then obtained four 20-gram cubes of different metal types."],
