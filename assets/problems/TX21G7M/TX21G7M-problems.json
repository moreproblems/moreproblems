To find the value of w, the student could have multiplied 28 by 200, resulting 80 200 in 5,600, and then divided 5,600 by 80, resulting in w = 70 visitors who prefer camping. Similarly, proportions to find the predicted number of visitors who prefer hiking trails, x; the number of visitors who prefer water sports, y; and the number of visitors who prefer biking trails, z, are 22/80 = x/200, 14/80 = y/200, and 16/80 = z/200. Solving these proportions results in predicted numbers of 55 who prefer hiking trails, 35 who prefer water sports, and 40 who prefer biking trails. Therefore, the number of 14 y 16 z = , and = . Solving these proportions results in predicted numbers of 55 who prefer 80 200 80 200 hiking trails, 35 who prefer water sports, and 40 who prefer biking trails.

For each semicircle, the diameter (straight line going through the center of a circle connecting two points on the circle) is 3 centimeters. As a result, the radius (distance from the center of the circle to a point on the circle) of each semicircle is 1.5 centimeters, or half the length of the diameter. The student could have used the formulas for the areas of a triangle, rectangle, and circle from the Area section of the STAAR Grade 7 Mathematics Reference Materials page within the student’s test booklet (triangle: A = 1/2 • bh, where A = area of the triangle, b = the base, and h = the height; rectangle: A = bh, where A = area of the rectangle, b = the base, and h = the height; and circle: A = πr^2, where A = area of the circle, π = pi (approximately 3.14), and r = radius).

The question shows the rate of Jeremy’s travel to the location, which is 65 miles per hour. This situation is represented by the key characteristics of the equation 250 + 65x = 575."
