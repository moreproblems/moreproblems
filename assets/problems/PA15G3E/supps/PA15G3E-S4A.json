        [" ", "\tGuagua Pichincha is a kind of volcano called a composite cone. It’s a mountain built up by two kinds of eruptions. One spews volcanic ash and cinders. The other kind sends thick lava flowing over the ash and cinders. Each time the volcano has one of these major eruptions, it grows taller, with more layers of cinders or fluid lava or both. The eruption in 1999 was less violent than either of those types. Mostly, it ejected volcanic ash into the air."],
        [" ", "\tThe volcano now stands 4,784 meters (15,695 feet) above sea level. That’s taller than 12 Empire State Buildings stacked on top of one another and about only half as tall as Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain."],
