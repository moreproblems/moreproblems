Since these angles have equal measure, they are corresponding angles. It follows that angle C corresponds to angle F. Let x° represent the measure of angle C. Since the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, it follows that 18° + 90° + x° = 180°, or 108° + x° = 180°.

The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy-plane intersects the y-axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y-axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius. It follows that the x-coordinate of the circle's center must be equivalent to the length of the circle's radius. In other words, if the graph of `(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2` is a circle that intersects the y-axis at exactly one point, then r h= must be true. The equation in this choice is (x - 4)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 16, or (x - 4)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 4^2. This equation is in the form `(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2`, where h = 4, k = 9, and r = 4, and represents a circle in the xy-plane with center (4, 9) and radius of length 4.

Let n represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours. Since it's given that x is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression n(x - 2). Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 220 + n(x - 2). It's given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is $400. Substituting 5 for x and 400 for f(x) into the equation f(x) = 220 + n(x - 2) yields 400 = 220 + n(5 - 2), or 400 = 220 + 3n. Subtracting 220 from both sides of this equation yields 180 = 3n. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields n = 60. Substituting 60 for n in the equation f(x) = 220 + n(x - 2) yields f(x) = 220 + 60(x - 2), which is equivalent to f(x) = 220 + 60x - 120, or f(x) = 60x + 100. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 60x + 100.",
