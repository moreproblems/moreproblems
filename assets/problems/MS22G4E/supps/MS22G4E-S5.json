        ["1", "\tNeil and I put on our space suits. Neil climbed out first and descended Eagle's ladder to the Moon's surface. Everyone listening back on Earth heard Neil's first words: “That's one small step for ... man, one giant leap for mankind.”"],
        ["2", "\tI climbed down the ladder and joined Neil. There was no color on the Moon. A flat landscape of rocks and cratersstretched in all directions. Everything was gray or white. Theshadows and the sky above were as black as the blackest velvet I had ever seen. I exclaimed: “Magnificent desolation.”"],
        ["3", "\tI could see Earth, our home, in the sky overhead—blue water, white clouds, and brown land. I could see thecontinents, and I knew that they were younger than the Moon dust in which Neil and I were now leaving our footprints."]
