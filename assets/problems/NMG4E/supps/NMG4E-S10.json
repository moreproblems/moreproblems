Observe it as you draw.\n\n• Draw on leaves. Collect some leaves from outside. Now, use markers or other art materials to decorate the leaves. Glue them on a piece of paper.\n\n• Mold something from modeling clay. With help from an adult, you can even make your own modeling clay at home. Use your fingers to make different shapes of insects, people, and animals.\n\n• Trace an interesting picture. Find a picture you like and put a thin piece of paper on top of it. Trace the picture using a pencil. when you are done, decorate and add to the picture in any way you like."],
