        ["1", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 1: There once was an old farmer who had three sons. The oldest son was named Hans. Fritz was the middle son, and the youngest was called Kurt. The farmer loved his boys dearly and they worked beside each other every day doing the endless chores that needed to be done on the farm."],
        ["2", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: My jobs require great skill with animals. I milk the cows, shear the sheep, and feed the pigs."],
        ["3", "𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭: I am a plant specialist. I plow the fields, sow the seed, and reap the harvest."],
        ["4", "𝗞𝗨𝗥𝗧: I do all the jobs that are left. I churn the butter, wash the clothes, and make the candles. Blech!"],
        ["5", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 2: Sometimes Kurt longed to help his older brothers."],
        ["6", "𝗙𝗔𝗥𝗠𝗘𝗥: Boys, gather around. I have finally figured out a fair way to choose which of you will inherit my farm. Here is my plan. We will pick one day. Each of you will have a turn to fill up the old barn before that day is done. Whoever can a͟c͟c͟o͟m͟p͟l͟i͟s͟h this task will have the farm."],
        ["7", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: But what shall we use to fill it?"],
        ["8", "𝗙𝗔𝗥𝗠𝗘𝗥: Whatever you choose. Does that sound fair?"],
        ["9", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦, 𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭, 𝗞𝗨𝗥𝗧: Yes, Father."],
        ["10", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 2: As the boys went about their chores that day, each thought about how he would fill the barn."],
        ["11", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: With my skills with the animals, I cannot lose."],
        ["12", "𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭: No one knows more about crops than I. Soon this farm will be mine."],
        ["13", "𝗞𝗨𝗥𝗧: I have no good ideas. I must not get discouraged though, or I will never win the farm. I have to keep thinking."],
        ["14", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 3: At last the day of the contest arrived. Everyone was up at dawn."],
        ["15", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: Of course, since I am oldest, I will go first. Stand aside everyone."],
        ["16", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 1: And with great skill, Hans packed every last farm animal into the barn. There was not enough room for even one more chicken on the barn floor that was packed full of horses, cows, sheep, pigs, and cats."],
        ["17", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: It looks like the farm will be mine, brother Fritz."],
        ["18", "𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭: We shall see. First, I will lead all the animals out of the barn. And now, hand me a pitchfork, Kurt."],
        ["19", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 2: And Fritz proceeded to fill the barn to the rafters with hay."],
        ["20", "𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭: Now who do you think will win the farm, older brother?"],
        ["21", "𝗙𝗔𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗥: Fritz, you have certainly filled the barn more than Hans did, but don't forget about Kurt. We must give your younger brother his chance."],
        ["22", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 3: The three boys cleared all the hay out of the barn. By the time they had finished, night had fallen."],
        ["23", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: Your turn, baby brother."],
        ["24", "𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭: Let us see what you can do in the time that's left."],
        ["25", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 1: Kurt spoke not a word. He simply reached into the pocket of his overalls. He pulled out a candle and lit it. Immediately, light filled the barn. It reached past the beams and rafters to the roof and spilled out the windows and doors."],
        ["26", "𝗛𝗔𝗡𝗦: Amazing!"],
        ["27", "𝗙𝗥𝗜𝗧𝗭: I cannot believe it. You did it!"],
        ["28", "𝗙𝗔𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗥: There is no doubt, Kurt. You have won the farm!"],
        ["29", "𝗞𝗨𝗥𝗧: Thank you, Father. I am very grateful. But I don't want to live on this big farm all by myself. I want to shear the sheep and reap the harvest with my brothers. And I want my brothers to wash the clothes and churn the butter with me. Agreed?"],
        ["30", "𝗡𝗔𝗥𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗢𝗥 2: So the three brothers agreed to share the farm and housework and they lived happily together on the farm for the rest of their lives."]
