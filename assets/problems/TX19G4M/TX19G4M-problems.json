Then the student should have subtracted the smaller measure from the larger measure. On the inside scale (the measurement values shown on the protractor), one ray of this angle passes through 130° and the other ray passes through 90°, so the measure of angle RST is 40° (130° – 90°). On the outside scale, one ray passes through 90° and the other ray passes through 50°, so the measure of the angle is 40° (90° – 50°).",
