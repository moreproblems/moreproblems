Originally, most peppered moths were light-colored and blended in with the light-colored bark of the trees in their environment. Due to pollution during the Industrial Revolution, the trees became blackened by soot. As a result, the population of light-colored moths decreased, due to predators. At the same time, the population of dark-colored moths increased, because they were less visible to predators."],
