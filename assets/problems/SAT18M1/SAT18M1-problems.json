Squaring both sides of √(2x + 6) = x - 1 yields 2x + 6 = x^2- 2x + 1. This equation can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in standard form: x^2- 4x - 5 = 0. One way to solve this quadratic equation is to factor the expression x^2- 4x - 5 by identifying two numbers with a sum of -4 and a product of -5. These numbers are -5 and 1. So the quadratic equation can be factored as (x - 5)(x + 1) = 0. It follows that 5 and -1 are the solutions to the quadratic equation. However, the solutions must be verified by checking whether 5 and -1 satisfy the original equation, √(2x + 6) + 4 = x + 3. When x = -1, the original equation gives √(2(-1) + 6) + 4 = (-1) + 3, or 6 = 2, which is false. Therefore, -1 does not satisfy the original equation. When x = 5, the original equation gives √(2(5) + 6) + 4 = 5 + 3, or 8 = 8, which is true. Therefore, x = 5 is the only solution to the original equation, and so the solution set is {5}.",

Since point P (10, -5) and point Q (x₁, y₁) are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center (6, -5) lies on the diameter, halfway between P and Q. Therefore, the following relationships hold: (x₁ + 10)/2 = 6 and (y₁ + (-5))/2 = -5. Solving the equations for x₁ and y₁, respectively, yields x₁ = 2 and y₁ = -5. Therefore, the coordinates of point Q are (2, -5).\nAlternate approach: Since point P (10, -5) on the circle and the center of the circle (6, -5) have the same y-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is 10 - 6 = 4.

The first equation can be rewritten as y = -x + 60. Substituting -x + 60 for y in the equation 2x + 4y = 202 yields 2x + 4(-x + 60) = 202. Distributing and combining like terms gives -2x + 240 = 202. Subtracting 240 from both sides of -2x + 240 = 202 and then dividing both sides by -2 gives x = 19. Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.\nAlternate approach: If each of the 60 tents held 4 people, the total number of people that could be accommodated in tents would be 240. However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents.
