                    "Rationale": "Juliene practiced twice as long on Monday as she did on Tuesday. Therefore, if x is the number of minutes Juliene practiced on Tuesday, then 2x is the number of minutes she practiced on Monday. The total amount of time Juliene practiced on the two days is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which is equal to 135 minutes. Thus, the equation x + 2x = 135 must be true. This simplifies to 3x = 135, and so x = 45. The number of minutes Juliene practiced on Monday is 2x, which is equal to 2x = 2(45) = 90.",

Multiplying out the right-hand side of the equation gives 12x² + ax − 20 = 3mx² + (3p + 4m)x + 4p. It follows that 12 = 3m, a = 3p + 4m, and −20 = 4p. Dividing both sides of the equation 12 = 3m by 3 gives m = 4. Dividing both sides of the equation −20 = 4p by 4 gives p = −5. Finally, substituting m = 4 and p = −5 in the equation a = 3p + 4m gives a = 3(−5) + 4(4) = 1.",
