The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the `xy`-plane intersects the `y`-axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the `y`-axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius. It follows that the `x`-coordinate of the circle's center must be equivalent to the length of the circle's radius. In other words, if the graph of `(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2` is a circle that intersects the `y`-axis at exactly one point, then `r=abs(h)` must be true. The equation in this choice is `(x-4)^2+(y-9)^2=16`, or `(x-4)^2 +(y-9)^2=4^2`.

Substituting `4` for `r` and `4` for `h` in the equation `r=abs(h)` yields `4=abs(4)`, or `4=4`, which is true.
