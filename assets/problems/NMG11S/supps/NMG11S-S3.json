The student has no ice to chill his lemonade, so he mixes in cold lemon juice from the refrigerator with room temperature water and sugar. When he finishes mixing, the lemonade mixture is warmer than he expects. He adds even more cold lemon juice to make the mixture cooler, but this makes the lemonade much too sour to drink. The student decides to investigate how mixing different amounts of warm and cold liquids affects the final temperature of the mixture."],
