They first find out the average distance between Earth and the sun and set up a demonstration in the gym. They place a bright lamp in the center of the room to represent the sun. Then, they put tape in a path that represents Earth's orbit around the sun. They label four different dates next to the tape that show where Earth is during four different times of the year. The diagram shows what the model looks like from above."],

A student tilts the ball at 23.5° and walks around the sun at the center of the gym. They also draw a black dot on the foam ball to represent Tennessee on Earth's surface in the Northern Hemisphere."],
