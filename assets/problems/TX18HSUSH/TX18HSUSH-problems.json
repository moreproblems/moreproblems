With the exception of preventing war, this is the greatest challenge that our country will face during our lifetime... It's a problem that we will not be able to solve in the next few years, and it's likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century... The oil and natural gas that we rely on for 75 percent of our energy are simply running out. In spite of increased effort, domestic production has been dropping steadily at about 6 percent a year. Imports have doubled in the last 5 years... Unless profound changes are made to lower oil consumption, we now believe that early in the 1980s the world will be demanding more oil than it can produce.\n\n—President Jimmy Carter, address to the nation, April 18, 1977",
