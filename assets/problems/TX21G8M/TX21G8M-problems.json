The diagonal length of Screen W ( 12.25) results in the decimal 3.5, which converts to the fraction 42/12. The diagonal length of Screen X (2 1/6) results in the fraction 13/6, which converts to the fraction 26/12. The diagonal length of Screen Y (37/√144) converts to the fraction 37/12. The diagonal length of Screen Z (8/3) converts to the fraction 32/12. This results in fractions of 42/12, 26/12, 37/12, and 32/12. The student could then have ordered the diagonal lengths by comparing the fractions. The correct order of the fractions is 26/12, 32/12, 37/12, and 42/12, which means the shortest diagonal length is 26/12, which is the diagonal length for Screen X.

A scale factor with the origin (point where the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical) on a coordinate grid intersect (cross); also, the point represented by the ordered pair (0, 0)) as the center of dilation means that each point on the dilated figure will be a certain number of times as far from the origin as it was on the original figure. Since the location of vertex Q was originally represented at (6, 2), and the location of the corresponding vertex (vertex Q′) on the dilated figure is at (21, 7), the scale factor of the dilation can be determined by dividing the value of each corresponding coordinate of vertex Q′ by the value of each corresponding coordinate of vertex Q (21 ÷ 6 = 7/2 and 7 ÷ 2 = 7/2), so the rule (x, y) → (7x, 7y) represents the dilation.",

Any extra zeros prior to that number are not included within the scientific notation. The number of decimal places the point moves determines the value of the exponent (number raised to a power). The direction the decimal point is moved determines whether the exponent is positive or negative. Moving the decimal point to the right creates a negative exponent.
