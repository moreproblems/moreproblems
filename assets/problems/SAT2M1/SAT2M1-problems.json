It's given that the owner pays `$4.90` per candle to purchase small candles and `$11.60` per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays `4.90stext( dollars)` for `s` small candles and `11.60l text( dollars)` for `l` large candles, which means the owner pays a total of `4.90s+11.60l text( dollars)` to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets `$2,200` to purchase candles. Therefore, `4.90s+11.60lge2,200`. It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of `200` candles. Therefore, `s+lge200`. The inequalities `4.90s+11.60lle2,200` and `s+lge200` can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting `l` from both sides of the inequality `s+lge200` yields `sge200`. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by `4.90` yields `4.90ge4.90(200-l)`, or `4.90sge980-4.90l`. Adding `11.60l` to both sides of this inequality yields `4.90s+11.60lge980-4.90l+11.60l`, or `4.90s+11.60lge980+6.70l`. This inequality can be combined with the inequality `4.90s+11.60lle2,200`, which yields the compound inequality `980+6.70le4.90s+11.60lle2,200`. It follows that `980+6.70lle2,200`. Subtracting `980` from both sides of this inequality yields `6.70lle2,200`. Dividing both sides of this inequality by `6.70` yields approximately `lle182.09`. Since the number of large candles the owner purchases must be a whole number, the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase is the largest whole number less than `182.09`, which is `182`.",

Since `/_SOP` and `/_ROQ` are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc `overarc(PS)` and arc `overarc(QR)` are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, `/_SOR` and `/_POQ` are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc `overarc(SR)` and arc `overarc(PQ)` are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let `x` represent the length of arc `overarc(SR)`. Since arc `overarc(SR)` and arc `overarc(PQ)` are congruent arcs, the length of arc `overarc(PQ)` can also be represented by `x`. It's given that the length of arc `overarc(PS)` is twice the length of arc `overarc(PQ)`. Therefore, the length of arc `overarc(PS)` can be represented by the expression `2x`. Since arc PS and arc `overarc(QR)` are congruent arcs, the length of arc `overarc(QR)` can also be represented by `2x`. This gives the expression `x+x+2x+2x`. Since it's given that the circumference is `144pi`, the expression `x+x+2x+2x` is equal to `144pi`. Thus `x+x+2x+2x=144pi`, or `6x=144pi`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `6` yields `x=24pi`. Therefore, the length of arc `overarc(QR)` is `2(24pi)`, or `48pi`.",

Because it's given that `21` people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that `x+y=21`. Since the company's revenue is `60text( dollars)` per child, the total revenue from `xtext( children)` in this group was `60xtext( dollars)`. Since the company's revenue is `80text( dollars)` per adult, the total revenue from `ytext( adults)` in this group was `80ytext( dollars)`. Because it's given that the total revenue for this group was `1,440text( dollars)`, it must be true that `60x+80y=1,440`. The equations `x+y=21` and `60x+80y=1,440` form a linear system of equations that can be solved to find the value of `x`, which represents the number of children in the group, using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the equation `x+y=21` by `80` yields `80x+80y=1,680`. Subtracting `60x+80y=1,440` from `80x+80y=1,680` yields `(80x + 80y)-(60x+80y)=1,680-1,440`, which is equivalent to `80x-60x+80y-80y=240`, or `20x=240`.

                    "Rationale": "According to the first equation in the given system, the value of `y` is `-1.5`. Substituting `-1.5` for `y` in the second equation in the given system yields `-1.5=x^2+8x+a`. Adding `1.5` to both sides of this equation yields `0=x^2+8x+a+1.5`. If the given system has exactly one distinct real solution, it follows that `0=x^2+8x+a+1.5` has exactly one distinct real solution. A quadratic equation in the form `0=px^2+qx+r`, where `p`, `q`, and `r` are constants, has exactly one distinct real solution if and only if the discriminant, `q^2-4pr`, is equal to `0`. The equation `0=x^2+8x+a+1.5` is in this form, where `p=1`, `q=8`, and `r=a+1.5`. Therefore, the discriminant of the equation `0=x^2+8x+a+1.5` is `(8)^2-4(1)(a+1.5)`, or `58-4a`. Setting the discriminant equal to `0` to solve for `a` yields `58-4a=0`. Adding `4a` to both sides of this equation yields `58=4a`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `4` yields `58/4=a`, or `29/2=a`. Therefore, if the given system of equations has exactly one distinct real solution, the value of `a` is `29/2`.",

It's given that the side lengths of the right triangle `RST` are `RS=20`, `ST=48`, and `TR=52`. Corresponding angles in similar triangles are equal. It follows that the measure of angle `T` is equal to the measure of angle `W`. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the longest side. It follows that the hypotenuse of triangle `RST` is side `TR`. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite the right angle. Therefore, angle `S` is a right angle. The adjacent side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the adjacent side of angle `T` is side `ST`. The opposite side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side across from the acute angle. It follows that the opposite side of angle `T` is side `RS`. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, `tan(T)=(RS)/(ST)`. Substituting `20` for `RS` and `48` for `ST` in this equation yields `tan(T)=20/48`, or `tan(T)=5/12`. The tangents of two acute angles with equal measures are equal. Since the measure of angle `T` is equal to the measure of angle `W`, it follows that `tan(T)=tan(W)`. Substituting `5/12` for `tan(T)` in this equation yields `5/12=tan(W)`.

It's also given that the number `b` is `90%` less than `47`. It follows that `b=(1-90/100)(47)` or `b=0.1(47)`, which yields `b=4.7`. Substituting `4.7` for `b` in the equation `a=2.1b` yields `a=2.1(4.7)`, which is equivalent to `a=9.87`. Therefore, the value of `a` is `9.87`.",
