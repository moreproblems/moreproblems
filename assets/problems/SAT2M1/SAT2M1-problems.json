                    "Rationale": "Let s represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let l represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It’s given that the owner pays $4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays 4.90s dollars for s small candles and 11.60l dollars for l large candles, which means the owner pays a total of 4.90s + 11.60l dollars to purchase candles. It’s given that the owner budgets $2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, 4.90s + 11.60l ≥ 2,200. It’s also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, s + l ≥ 200. The inequalities 4.90s + 11.60l ≤ 2,200 and s + l ≥ 200 can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting l from both sides of the inequality s + l ≥ 200 yields s ≥ 200. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 4.90 yields 4.90 ≥ 4.90(200 - l), or 4.90s ≥ 980 - 4.90l. Adding 11.60l to both sides of this inequality yields 4.90s + 11.60l ≥ 980 - 4.90l + 11.60l, or 4.90s + 11.60l ≥ 980 + 6.70l. This inequality can be combined with the inequality 4.90s + 11.60l ≤ 2,200, which yields the compound inequality 980 + 6.70 ≤ 4.90s + 11.60l  ≤ 2,200. It follows that 980 + 6.70l ≤ 2,200. Subtracting 980 from both sides of this inequality yields l ≤ 6.70 2,200. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 6.70 yields approximately l ≤ 182.09. Since the number of large candles the owner purchases must be a whole number, the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase is the largest whole number less than 182.09, which is 182.",

                    "Rationale": "Since PR and QS are diameters of the circle shown, OS, OR, OP, and OQ are radii of the circle and are therefore congruent. Since ∠SOP and ∠ROQ are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc PS and arc QR are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, ∠SOR and ∠POQ are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc SR and arc PQ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let x represent the length of arc SR . Since arc SR and arc PQ are congruent arcs, the length of arc PQ can also be represented by x . It’s given that the length of arc PS is twice the length of arc PQ. Therefore, the length of arc PS can be represented by the expression 2x. Since arc PS and arc QR are congruent arcs, the length of arc QR can also be represented by 2x. This gives the expression x + x + 2x + 2x. Since it’s given that the circumference is 144π, the expression x + x + 2x + 2x is equal to π 144π. Thus 2 2 144 x + x + 2x + 2x = 144π, or 6x = 144π. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields x = 24π. Therefore, the length of arc QR is (24π), or 48π.",

Because it’s given that 21 people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that x + y = 21 . Since the company’s revenue is 60 dollars per child, the total revenue from x children in this group was 60x dollars. Since the company’s revenue is 80 dollars per adult, the total revenue from y adults in this group was 80y dollars. Because it’s given that the total revenue for this group was 1,440 dollars, it must be true that 60x + 80y = 1,440. The equations x + y = 21 and 60x + 80y = 1,440 form a linear system of equations that can be solved to find the value of x, which represents the number of children in the group, using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the equation x + y = 21 by 80 yields 80x + 80y = 1,680. Subtracting 60x + 80y = 1,440 from 80x + 80y = 1,680 yields (80x + 80y) - (60x + 80y) = 1,680 - 1,440, which is equivalent to 80x - 60x + 80y - 80y = 240, or 20x = 240.

Substituting -1.5 for y in the second equation in the given system yields -1.5 = x² + 8x + a. Adding 1.5 to both sides of this equation yields 0 = x² + 8x + a + 1.5. If the given system has exactly one distinct real solution, it follows that 0 = x² + 8x + a + 1.5 has exactly one distinct real solution. A quadratic equation in the form 0 = px² + qx + r, where p, q, and r are constants, has exactly one distinct real solution if and only if the discriminant, q² - 4pr, is equal to 0. The equation 0 = x² + 8x + a + 1.5 is in this form, where p = 1, q = 8, and r = a + 1.5. Therefore, the discriminant of the equation 0 = x² + 8x + a + 1.5 is (8)² - 4(1)(a + 1.5), or 58 - 4a. Setting the discriminant equal to 0 to solve for a yields 58 - 4a = 0. Adding 4a to both sides of this equation yields 58 = 4a. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields 58/4 = a, or 29/2 = a.

Since the y-intercept of the graph shown is (0, 2), the value of b is 2. Since the graph also passes through the point (4, 1), the slope can be calculated as (1 - 2)/(4 - 0), or -1/4. Therefore, the value of m is -1/4. Substituting -1/4 for m and 2 for b in the equation y = mx + b yields y = (-1/4)x + 2. It’s given that an equation for the graph shown is y = f(x) + 14. Substituting f(x) + 14 for y in the equation y = (-1/4)x + 2 yields f(x) + 14 = (-1/4)x + 2. Subtracting 14 from both sides of this equation yields f(x) = (-1/4)x - 12.",

                    "Rationale": " It’s given that right triangle RST is similar to triangle UVW, where S corresponds to V and T corresponds to W. It’s given that the side lengths of the right triangle RST are RS = 20, ST = 48, and TR = 52. Corresponding angles in similar triangles are equal. It follows that the measure of angle T is equal to the measure of angle W . The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the longest side. It follows that the hypotenuse of triangle RST is side TR. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite the right angle. Therefore, angle S is a right angle. The adjacent side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the adjacent side of angle T is side ST. The opposite side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side across from the acute angle. It follows that the opposite side of angle T is side RS. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, tan(T) = RS/ST. Substituting 20 for RS and 48 for ST in this equation yields tan(T) = 20/48, or tan(T) = 5/12. The tangents of two acute angles with equal measures are equal. Since the measure of angle T is equal to the measure of angle W, it follows that tan(T) = tan(W). Substituting 5/12 for tan(T) in this equation yields 5/12 = tan(W). Therefore, the value of tan(W) is 5/12.",

Dividing the total area, in square feet, of the surface to be painted by the number of square feet covered by one gallon of paint gives the number of gallons of paint that will be needed.
