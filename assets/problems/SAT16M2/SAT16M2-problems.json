Therefore, the equation that models the height of the sunflower t days after it begins to grow is of the form h = 4.5t + b. Any ordered pair (t, h) from the table between day 14 and day 35 can be used to estimate the value of b. For example, substituting the ordered pair (14, 36.36) for (t, h) into the equation h = 4.5t + b gives 36.36 = 4.5(14) + b. Solving this for b yields b = −26.64.

According to the architect's design, the total rise of the stairway is 9 feet, or 9 × 12 = 108 inches. Hence, nh = 108, and solving for n gives 108/h. It is given that 7 < h < 8. It follows that 108/8 < 108/h < 108/7, or equivalently, 108/8 < n < 108/7. Since 108/8 < 14 and 108/7 > 15 and n is an integer, it follows that 14 ≤ n ≤ 15. Since n can be an odd number, n can only be 15; therefore, h = 108/15 = 7.2 inches. Substituting 7.2 for h in the riser-tread formula 2h + d = 25 gives 14.4 + d = 25. Solving for d gives d = 10.6 inches.",

To do this, divide the original equation, 2x² − 6x + 2y² + 2y = 45, by 2 to make the leading coefficients of x² and y² each equal to 1: x² − 3x + y² + y = 22.5. Then complete the square to put the equation in standard form. To do so, first rewrite x² − 3x + y² + y = 22.5 as (x² − 3x + 2.25) − 2.25 + (y² + y + 0.25) − 0.25 = 22.5. Second, add 2.25 and 0.25 to both sides of the equation: (x² − 3x + 2.25) + (y² + y + 0.25) = 25. Since x² − 3x + 2.25 = (x − 1.5)², y² − x + 0.25 = (y − 0.5)², and 25 = 5², it follows that (x − 1.5)² + (y − 0.5)² = 5². Therefore, the radius of the circle is 5.",

The smallest possible volume, in cubic inches, of a graduated cylinder produced by the laboratory supply company can be found by substituting 2 for r and 7.75 for h, giving V = π(2²)(7.75). This gives a volume of approximately 97.39 cubic inches, which rounds to97 cubic inches. The largest possible volume, in cubic inches, can be found by substituting 2 for r and 8 for h, giving V = π(2²)(8). This gives a volume of approximately 100.53 cubic inches, which rounds to 101 cubic inches. Therefore, the possible volumes are all the integers greater than or equal to 97 and less than or equal to 101, which are 97, 98, 99, 100, and 101.

Factoring 3x out of each term on the left-hand side of the equation gives 0 = 3x(x − 5). Therefore, the possible values for x are 0 and 5.

Since the mean mass of the rocks Maria collected is 0.1 kilogram greater than the mean mass of rocks Andrew collected, the mean mass of the rocks Maria collected is 2.8 + 0.1 = 2.9 kilograms. The value of x can be found by using the algorithm for finding the mean (x + 3.1 + 2.7 + 2.9 + 3.3 + 2.8)/6 = 2.9. Solving this equation gives x = 2.6, which is equivalent to 13/5.",
