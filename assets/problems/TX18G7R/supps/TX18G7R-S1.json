        ["1", "\tWhen I complained to Mom over the phone yesterday about the extreme depths of boredom I had experienced during the first week of my summer exile to my grandparents’ farm, she suggested I think of my grandparents’ farm as an exotic location. “After all,” she said, “not everyone gets the opportunity to live on a farm.”"],
        ["2", "\tThat gave me an idea. I decided I would compose my social media status updates as if I were an i͟l͟l͟u͟s͟t͟r͟i͟o͟u͟s traveler visiting the Serengeti Plain and making keen observations to my fans about my surroundings. I started early the next morning."],
        ["3", ":box:Alyssa’s Status: 5:54 A.M. The glorious male Gallus gallus domesticus, more commonly known as the rooster, perches himself upon the post. His delicate feathers glimmer in the sunrise. He flaps his wings twice and rears back his head. His call clamors through the countryside, crying out to all creatures that morning has come.\n\n14 Thumbs Up"],
        ["4", "\tTo add to my suffering, my best friends were each doing something exciting. Carlos was at the beach rescuing sea turtles, and Natalia was with her mother, who is an interior designer working on a project for a famous client in a big city."],

        ["13", ":box:Alyssa’s Status: 1:34 P.M. Few events cause more excitement in this remote part of the world than the ripening of the blackberries, a cause for celebration among the local inhabitants who make the annual pilgrimage to a special place known as “Haverford’s.” After the festivities have concluded, a ceremonial cobbler—a sweet dessert—is baked with the ripest of the day’s bounty.\n\n18 Thumbs Up"],

        ["20", "\tThat had potential for a worthy photo to post online. I could take a picture of the run-down barn and make up a story—maybe an unsolved mystery. I could tweak the brightness and contrast settings of the photograph, slightly changing them to make the picture look eerie."],

        ["24", "\tI gathered myself and went toward the sound. When I saw what was in one of the stalls, I let out a high-pitched squeal—baby foxes! They were crawling out of a hole and then tumbling back down. They were adorable. I probably took a hundred photos."],
        ["25", "\t“Fox kits,” Grandma said later when she saw the photographs I had taken. “I’ve seen a fox around and wondered if she had a den. You should put one of these on your social studies page.”"],
