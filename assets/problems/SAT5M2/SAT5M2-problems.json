Since the length of the garden will be 5 feet longer than the width of the garden, the length of the garde  will be w + 5 feet. Thus the area of the garden will be w(w + 5). It is also given that the area of the garden will be 104 square feet. Therefore, w(w + 5) = 104, which is equivalent to w² + 5w − 104 = 0. The quadratic formula can be used or the equation above can be factored to result in (w + 13)(w − 8) = 0. Therefore, w = 8 and w = −13. Because width cannot be negative, the width of the garden must be 8 feet. This means the length of the garden must be 8 + 5 = 13 feet.",

Simplifying this equation gives x°/2 = 40°, and so x = 80.\nAlternate approach: If points A and P are joined, then the triangles that will be formed, APB and APC, are isosceles because PA = PB = PC. It follows that the base angles on both triangles each have measure of 20°. Angle A consists of two base angles, and therefore, m∠A = 40°. Since the measure of an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc, it follows that the value of x is 80°.",
