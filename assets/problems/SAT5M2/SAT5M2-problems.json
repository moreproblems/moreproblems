Dividing both sides of this inequality by -1 yields y < -3. Therefore, when x = 440, the corresponding value of y must be less than -3. Substituting 441 for x in the given inequality yields 2(441) - y > 883, or 882 - y > 883. Subtracting 882 from both sides of this inequality yields -y > 1. Dividing both sides of this inequality by -1 yields y < -1. Therefore, when x = 441, the corresponding value of y must be less than -1. Substituting 442 for x in the given inequality yields 2(442) - y > 883, or 884 - y > 883. Subtracting 884 from both sides of this inequality yields -y > -1. Dividing both sides of this inequality by -1 yields y < 1. Therefore, when x = 442, the corresponding value of y must be less than 1. For the table in this choice, when x = 440, the corresponding value of y is -4, which is less than -3; when x = 441, the corresponding value of y is -2, which is less than -1; when x = 442, the corresponding value of y is 0, which is less than 1. Therefore, the table in this choice gives values of x and their corresponding values of y that are all solutions to the given inequality.",

                    "Rationale": "It’s given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let s represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it’s given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, 2s represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b, then a² + b² = c². Substituting s for a and 2s for c in this equation yields s² + b² = (2s)², or s² + b² = 4s². Subtracting s² from both sides of this equation yields b² = 3s². Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields b = s√3. Therefore, the length, in units, of the rectangle’s longest side is s√3. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the shortest side and the length of the longest side. The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by s and s√3, and it’s given that the area of the rectangle is 1,089√3 square units. It follows that 1,089√3 = s(s√3), or 1,089√3 = s²√3 Dividing both sides of this equation by √3 yields 1,089 = s². Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields 33 = s. Since the length, in units, of the diagonal is represented by 2s, it follows that the length, in units, of the diagonal is 2(33), or 66. Since the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, the length, in units, of the diameter of the circle is 66.",

Therefore, the points (-1, 1) and (5, -4) are the endpoints of the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. The slope of a line or line segment that contains the points (a, b) and (c, d) can be calculated as (d - b)/(c - a). Substituting (1, -1) for (a, b) and (5, -4) for (c, d) in the expression (d - b)/(c - a) yields (-4 - 1)/(5 - (-1)), or -5/6. Thus, the slope of this radius is -5/6. A line that’s tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. It follows that line t is perpendicular to the radius at the point (5, -4), so the slope of line t is the negative reciprocal of the slope of this radius. The negative reciprocal of -5/6 is 6/5. Therefore, the slope of line t is 6/5. Since the slope of line t is the same between any two points on line t, a point lies on line t if the slope of the line segment connecting the point and (5, -4) is 6/5. Substituting this choice, (10, 2), for (a, b) and (5, -4) for (c, d) in the expression (d - b)/(c - a) yields (-4 - 2)/(5 - 10), or 6/5. Therefore, the point (10, 2) lies on line t.",

This means that the area of the larger square is 3², or 9, times the area of the smaller square. If the area of the smaller square is represented by x, then the area of the larger square can be represented by 9x. Therefore, the flat surface of the two adjacent squares has a total area of x + 9x, or 10x. It’s given that an electric field with strength 29.00 volts per meter passes uniformly through this surface and the total electric flux of the electric field through this surface is 4,640 volts • meters. Since it’s given that the electric flux is the product of the electric field’s strength and the area of the surface, the equation 29.00(10x) = 4,640, or 290x = 4,640, can be used to represent this situation. Dividing each side of this equation by 290 yields x = 16. Substituting 16 for x in the expression for the area of the larger square, 9x, yields 9(16), or 144, square meters. Since the area of the larger square is 144 square meters, the electric flux, in volts • meters, of the electric field through the larger square can be determined by multiplying the area of the larger square by the strength of the electric field. Thus, the electric flux is (144 square meters)(29.00 volts/meter), or 4,176 volts • meters.",
