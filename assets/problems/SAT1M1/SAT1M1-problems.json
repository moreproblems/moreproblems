Since the number of cells per milliliter doubles every 3 hours, the relationship between x and y can be represented by an exponential equation of the form y = a(b)ˣ/ᵏ, where a is the number of cells per milliliter during the initial observation and the number of cells per milliliter increases by a factor of b every k hours. It's given that there were 300,000 cells per milliliter during the initial observation. Therefore, a = 300,000. It's also given that the number of cells per milliliter doubles, or increases by a factor of 2, every 3 hours. Therefore, b = 2 and k = 3. Substituting 300,000 for a, 2 for b, and 3 for k in the equation y = a(b)ˣ/ᵏ yields y = 300,000(2)ˣ/³. The number of cells per milliliter there will be 15 hours after the initial observation is the value of y in this equation when x = 15. Substituting 15 for x in the equation y = 300,000(2)ˣ/³ yields y = 300,000(2)¹⁵/³, or y = 300,000(2)⁵. This is equivalent to y = 300,000(32), or y = 9,600,000.

It's given that line h contains the points (18, 130), (23, 160), and (26, 178). Therefore, its slope m can be found as (160 – 130)/(23 – 18), or 6. Substituting 6 for m in the equation y = mx + b yields y = 6x + b. Substituting 130 for y and 18 for x in this equation yields 130 = 6(18) + b, or 130 = 108 + b. Subtracting 108 from both sides of this equation yields 22 = b. Substituting 22 for b in y = 6x + b yields y = 6x + 22. Since line k is the result of translating line h down 5 units, an equation of line k is y = 6x + 22 – 5, or y = 6x + 17. Substituting 0 for y in this equation yields 0 = 6x + 17. Solving this equation for x yields x = -17/6. Therefore, the x-intercept of line k is (–17/6, 0).",

A point (x, y) lies on the graph of an equation in the xy-plane if and only if this point represents a solution to the equation.

The height of the triangle, k√3, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the 60° angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of k√3, it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each 30° angle has a length of k and each hypotenuse has a length of 2k. In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is 2k. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 624; therefore, 2k + 2k + 2k = 624, or 6k = 624. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields k = 104.",
