Since the number of cells per milliliter doubles every 3 hours, the relationship between `x` and `y` can be represented by an exponential equation of the form y = a(b)ˣ/ᵏ, where a is the number of cells per milliliter during the initial observation and the number of cells per milliliter increases by a factor of b every k hours. It's given that there were 300,000 cells per milliliter during the initial observation. Therefore, a = 300,000. It's also given that the number of cells per milliliter doubles, or increases by a factor of 2, every 3 hours. Therefore, b = 2 and k = 3. Substituting 300,000 for a, 2 for b, and 3 for k in the equation y = a(b)ˣ/ᵏ yields y = 300,000(2)ˣ/³. The number of cells per milliliter there will be 15 hours after the initial observation is the value of y in this equation when x = 15. Substituting 15 for x in the equation y = 300,000(2)ˣ/³ yields y = 300,000(2)¹⁵/³, or y = 300,000(2)⁵. This is equivalent to y = 300,000(32), or y = 9,600,000. Therefore, 15 hours after the initial observation, there will be 9,600,000 cells per milliliter.",

                    "Rationale": "It's given that the measure of angle R is 2π/3 radians, and the measure of angle T is 5π/12 radians greater than the measure of angle R. Therefore, the measure of angle T is equal to 2π/3 + 5π/12 radians. Multiplying 2π/3 by 4/4 to get a common denominator with 5π/12 yields 8π/12. Therefore, 2π/3 + 5π/12 is equivalent to 8π/12 + 5π/12, or 13π/12. Therefore, the measure of angle T is 13π/12 radians. The measure of angle T, in degrees, can be found by multiplying its measure, in radians, by 180/π. This yields (13π/12)(180/π), which is equivalent to 195 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle T is 195 degrees.",

It's given that line h contains the points (18, 130), (23, 160), and (26, 178). Therefore, its slope m can be found as (160 - 130)/(23 - 18), or 6. Substituting 6 for m in the equation `y=mx+b` yields y = 6x + b. Substituting 130 for y and 18 for x in this equation yields 130 = 6(18) + b, or 130 = 108 + b. Subtracting 108 from both sides of this equation yields 22 = b. Substituting 22 for b in y = 6x + b yields y = 6x + 22. Since line k is the result of translating line h down 5 units, an equation of line k is y = 6x + 22 - 5, or y = 6x + 17. Substituting 0 for y in this equation yields 0 = 6x + 17.

The height of the triangle, k√3, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the 60° angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of k√3, it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each 30° angle has a length of k and each hypotenuse has a length of 2k. In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is 2k. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 624; therefore, 2k + 2k + 2k = 624, or 6k = 624. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields k = 104.",
