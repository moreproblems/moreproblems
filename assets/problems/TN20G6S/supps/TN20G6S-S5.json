        [" ", "The cold ocean waters off the coast of Peru, a country in South America, are some of the most nutrient-rich waters in the world. An ocean current named the Humboldt Current helps bring cold water up the western coast of South America from the Antarctic. This cold water can hold more oxygen than warm water can. As wind patterns push surface water away from the shore, deep water full of nutrients rises to the surface. This is called upwelling. The diagram shows how upwelling occurs."],

A food web for that ecosystem is shown. This food web shows the relationships among organisms, including anchovies, in the ecosystem. It also shows the movement of energy through the ecosystem. A basic energy pyramid is shown as well."],
