        [" ", "Natural events and human activity can threaten the health of the anchovy population off the coast of Peru. El Niño events are natural events that occur about every two to seven years. During these events, lower air pressure over South America results in changes to wind patterns. Normally winds blow from east to west, pushing surface water away from the coast of Peru. During El Niño events, winds blow from west to east. This pushes warm surface water toward Peru’s coast. The warm surface water contains less oxygen than cold water and blocks upwelling from bringing nutrients to the surface."],

In the 1970s, the fishing industry recognized the need to protect both the anchovies and the ocean ecosystem. As a result, the government set limits on the amount of anchovies a fishing boat could catch each year."],
