Armadillos dig large holes in the ground to sleep and live in, and they eat insects and worms that live in the ground. All types of armadillos have a shell, called a carapace, which is made up of hard pieces of bone (much like a turtle shell) that are connected to each other. The carapace can bend where the pieces of bones connect to each other, so it is both hard and flexible."],
