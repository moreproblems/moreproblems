A rock tumbler spins and tumbles rocks similar to how a washing machine spins and tumbles clothes. A rock tumbler is filled with sand and water to help weather the rocks inside. The data from the experiment suggest that certain igneous rocks weather at a slower rate than some sedimentary and metamorphic rocks exposed to the same conditions."],
