He notes, though, that people are usually able to adapt to change much better than they think they can.\n\nAccording to Gilbert, “We're not supposed to be happy all the time.” It's both normal and important to feel other types of emotions. We can appreciate happiness more if we don't always have it. As Gilbert says, “Happiness is a place to visit, not a place to live.” The next time you're feeling sad or even angry, remember that it is not really possible to always feel happy.",
