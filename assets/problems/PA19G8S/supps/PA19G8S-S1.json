The development of robotic insects has involved the use of high-speed videography to study the motion of insect wings during flight. This same technology is also being used in other laboratories to study the movement of cockroaches."],

        [" ", "Scientists have observed cockroaches flattening their bodies to move through cracks no thicker than two stacked pennies. Studying the video images, scientists observed the cockroaches using sensory spines on their legs to push against the floor instead of using their feet. Even more amazing, the cockroaches' speed remained nearly the same as when they were on their feet. Scientists also studied the cockroaches' jointed exoskeleton. It is made up of both hard plates and flexible membranes, which allow changes to the cockroaches' body shape. Their smooth wings also reduce resistance in tight spaces. All of these observations led to the development of a cockroach bot that can compress and squeeze through extremely small places."]
