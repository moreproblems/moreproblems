        [" ", "Humans first developed corn as a food crop over 8000 years ago. These early farmers produced corn by selectively breeding a wild grass called teosinte. The kernels of teosinte have a hard coating that makes them difficult for humans to eat. A key step in developing corn as a food crop was selecting individual plants that produced kernels without this coating so that they could more easily be used as a food source. The illustrations show the kernels on an ear of corn and the kernels on an ear of teosinte."],

To determine the inheritance pattern of this gene, scientists crossed teosinte that is true-breeding (homozygous) for kernel coating and domestic corn that is true-breeding for no kernel coating to produce offspring with partially formed kernel coatings. The three phenotypes and their genotypes are shown in the table."],
