Cars can now be found all over the world. Every one of them, from compact cars to giant SUVs, are thanks to Ford. The Model T originally sold for only $850. The first production plant was in Detroit, Michigan, and the first car rolled off the assembly line in 1908. The assembly line was another of Ford's major contributions. To reduce the cost of making the cars, he created a system where people were responsible for building one part of the car. That part then moved along a conveyor belt where the next person would add his part. This system of specialized assembly continues today in plants across many different industries.",

I was nervous and excited at the same time.\n\nDuring the week, I decided it would be a good idea to practice taking pictures. My adviser gave me a few tips and told me to capture the ball and players in motion. Luckily, my sister had a softball game Wednesday night where I was able to practice using the camera. Taking action shots was harder than I had thought. I took several ordinary shots before I was able to master the action shots.\n\nBy Friday, I felt ready to represent the yearbook club at the kickball game. I took pictures of the students in the stands and our school mascot leading a cheer. I got a great action shot of Mr. Paris, the math teacher, diving to catch the ball.
