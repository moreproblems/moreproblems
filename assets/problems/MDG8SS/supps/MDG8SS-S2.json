The Road passes, from end to end, through the richest and most fertile Prairies of the State... The recent opening of nearly six hundred miles of the Company's Railroad throws open their lands for cultivation, they being scattered for several miles in width, on each side of the Road, throughout its entire length.\n\nThe soil is a dark, rich mold, from one to five feet in depth, is gently rolling, and peculiarly fitted for grazing cattle and sheep, or the cultivation of wheat, Indian corn, etc.\n\nThe economy in cultivating and the productiveness of Illinois lands are well known. Trees are not required to be cut down, stumps grubbed, or stone picked off, as is generally the case in the cultivation of new land in the older States... Wheat sown on the newly-turned sod is sure to yield very large profits...\n\nCorn, grain, cattle, etc., will be forwarded at reasonable rates to Chicago, for the Eastern market, and to Cairo for the Southern...
