Blount established the capital at a location that later would become the city of Knoxville ...\n\nIn the 1790s American politics were defined largely by the struggles between Federalists ... and the Republicans ... Despite the Washington administration's appointment of William Blount as Territorial Governor, most Tennesseans identified with the Republicans. This tension, combined with the belief that the federal government was not doing enough to solve “the Indian problem,” led Blount to mount a campaign for statehood. Delegates convened in Knoxville in January 1796 to forge a state constitution and formally petition the Congress to grant statehood.\n\n\t —  William Lyons, Government and Politics in Tennessee",
