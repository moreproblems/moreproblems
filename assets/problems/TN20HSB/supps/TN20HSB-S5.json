        [" ", "Deer mice rely on other organisms for many nutrients. The food deer mice consume is broken down into smaller particles, absorbed, and distributed throughout their bodies. One of these particles is glucose. Glucose requires specialized molecules such as the GLUT4 transporter to enter cells. Once glucose is in a cell, it can be broken down further to provide energy for the growth, metabolism, and maintenance of individual deer mice. Glucose entering a cell by way of GLUT4 is shown in the model."],
