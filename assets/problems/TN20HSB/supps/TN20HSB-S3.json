        [" ", "White clover plants have the ability to produce the toxin cyanide under certain conditions. One hypothesis proposes that producing cyanide protects plants from herbivores such as insects, slugs, snails, and small mammals. When herbivores consume cyanide, it interferes with the ability of the mitochondrion to use oxygen during cellular respiration."],
        [" ", "Cytochrome c oxidase is a protein that is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. In the absence of cyanide, cytochrome c oxidase receives electrons in the electron transport chain. The electrons are joined with oxygen and hydrogen to make water. Some hydrogen ions are also pumped out to be used by the protein ATP synthase to create ATP. The diagram shows the movement of ions across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion."],
