        [" ", "The green sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, is a soft-bodied marine animal that lives off the eastern coast of North America in the Atlantic Ocean. The green sea slug feeds on algae. It is able to use chloroplasts from the algae, Vaucheria litorea, to perform photosynthesis and produce its own food. A young green sea slug is able to survive for nine months after feeding one time on V. litorea."],
        [" ", "It has been hypothesized that as the green sea slug feeds on V. litorea, it takes the chloroplasts from the algae. For the chloroplasts to continue working in the green sea slug, the green sea slug incorporates the algal genes that are needed to perform photosynthesis into its own DNA. This allows the green sea slug to produce the proteins needed for the chloroplasts to continue working due to common ancestry."],
