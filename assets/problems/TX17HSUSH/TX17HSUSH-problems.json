He asked magazines and newspapers to run stories warning of the dangers of rampant speculation.\n\nBut Presidents in 1929 were not supposed to regulate Wall Street, or even talk about the gyrating market for fear of inadvertently setting off a panic, and Hoover backed off.\n\n — Richard Norton Smith and Timothy Walch, “The Ordeal of Herbert Hoover,” 2004",
