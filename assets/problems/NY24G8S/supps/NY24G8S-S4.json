Town water districts obtain water from reservoirs (large bodies of water, such as lakes or ponds), town wells (where groundwater is pumped to the surface), and neighboring towns or cities. The town water district then processes the water received from multiple sources in a treatment plant to ensure it is safe to use. The water is then transported through pipes to homes and businesses."],
        [" ", "In order to maintain an adequate water supply for businesses, household use, and fire protection, a town water district may restrict water usage to ensure that sufficient water is available for residents and emergency services. In any system, some water is lost. Lost water leaves the system due to leaks, water main breaks, the flushing of hydrants, firefighting, theft, and water meter inaccuracy. A water meter measures the amount of water used in a building."],
