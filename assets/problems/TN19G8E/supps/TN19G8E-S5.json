        [" ", "\tErnest Rutherford's life story is both surprising and inspirational. Although [ambicious] in his youth, Ernest Rutherford could not have anticipated that he would one day become a famous scientist. Instead, he grew up on a farm in New Zealand where he labored in the fields. Then Rutherford left this small farm on a scholarship to study at Canterbury College. [After many years of hard work, he made a discovery. After a great deal of research, he discovered electrons. Electrons are fundamental particles of matter.]"],
        [" ", "\tElectrons, along with other very small particles, are found inside atoms. [Joined together into molecules, tiny atoms making up everything in the world.] [Nonetheless, the fact that there were particles even smaller than molecules or atoms was discovered by Rutherford.] As odd as it may seem, he demonstrated that the atom is similar in some ways to a big bowl of English pudding, which contains small bits of fruit. Electrons float around inside [the atom just as bits of fruit in a pudding doeS]. Rutherford's idea became known as the “plum pudding” model of the atom."],
        [" ", "\tBy identifying electrons, Rutherford helped explain natural events that had baffled people until then. This discovery demanded many years of work and great attention to details — details so small that no one before had seen them."]
