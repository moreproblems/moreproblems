Since there are 17 restaurants included in the data set and the numbers of employees are listed in ascending order, it follows that the median number of employees will be represented by the ninth restaurant in the list.

                    "Rationale": "Since the graph passes through the point (0, -6), it follows that when the value of x is 0, the value of y is -6. Substituting 0 for x and -6 for y in the given equation yields -6 = 2(0)² + b(0) + c, or -6 = c. Therefore, the value of c is 6-. Substituting 6- for c in the given equation yields y = 2x² + bx + c. Since the graph passes through the point (-1, 8), it follows that when the value of x is -1, the value of y is -8. Substituting -1 for x and -8 for y in the equation y = 2x² + bx + c yields -8 = 2(-1)² + b(-1) - 6, or -8 = 2 - b - 6, which is equivalent to -8 = -4 - b. Adding 4 to each side of this equation yields -4 = -b. Dividing each side of this equation by -1 yields 4 = b. Since the value of b is 4 and the value of c is -6, it follows that the value of bc is (4)(-6), or -24.\nAlternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at (-1, -8). Therefore, the given equation, y = 2x² + bx + c, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola and a is the value of the coefficient on the x2 term when the equation is written in standard form. It follows that a = 2. Substituting 2 for a, -1 for h, and -8 for k in this equation yields y = 2(x - (-1))² - 8, or y = 2(x + 1)² - 8. Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields y = 2(x² + 2x + 1) - 8. Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by 2 yields y = 2x² + 4x + 2 - 8, which is equivalent to y = 2x² + 4x - 6. From the given equation y = 2x² + bx + c, it follows that the value of b is 4 and the value of c is -6. Therefore, the value of bc is (4)(-6), or -24.",

It's given that circle B is the result of shifting circle A down 6 units and increasing the radius so that the radius of circle B is 2 times the radius of circle A. It follows that the center of circle B is 6 units below the center of circle A. The point that's 6 units below (-2, 0) has the same x-coordinate as (-2, 0) and has a y-coordinate that is 6 less than the y-coordinate of (-2, 0). Therefore, the coordinates of the center of circle B are (-2, 0 - 6), or (-2, -6). Since the radius of circle B is 2 times the radius of circle A, the radius of circle B is 2 3 ^ ^ h h.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180°, the measure of angle A is equal to 180° - (30 + 90)°, or 60°. In a right triangle whose acute angles have measures 30° and 60°, the lengths of the legs can be represented by the expressions x, x√3, and 2x, where x is the length of the leg opposite the angle with measure 30°, x√3 is the length of the leg opposite the angle with measure 60°, and 2x is the length of the hypotenuse. In the triangle shown, the hypotenuse has a length of 54. It follows that 2x = 54, or x = 27. Therefore, the length of the leg opposite angle B is 27 and the length of the leg opposite angle A is 27√3. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. The length of the leg opposite angle A is 27√3 and the length of the leg adjacent to angle A is 27. Therefore, the value of tan(A) is (27√3)/27, or √3.",

Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form C = Kaᵗ, where C is the estimated number of comments on the article t hours after the article was first featured on the home page and K and a are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were 40 comments on the article. This means that when t = 0, C = 40. Substituting 0 for t and 40 for C in the equation C = Kaᵗ yields 40 = Ka⁰, or 40 = K. It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by 190% of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: (40)(190/100), or 76 comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is 40 + 76, or 116. This means that when t = 1, C = 116. Substituting 1 for t, 116 for C, and 40 for K in the equation C = Kaᵗ yields 116 = 40aᵗ, or 116 = 40a. Dividing both sides of this equation by 40 yields 2.9 = a. Substituting 40 for K and 2.9 for a in the equation C = Kaᵗ yields C = 40(2.9)ᵗ. Thus, the equation that best represents this model is C = 40(2.9)ᵗ.",

It follows that an equation that defines f can be written in the form f(x) = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept (0, b) of the graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane. The slope of the graph of y = f(x) can be found using two points, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), that are on the graph of y = f(x), and the formula m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Since the table shows values of x and their corresponding values of g(x), substituting values of x and g(x) in the equation g(x) = f(x)/(x + 3) can be used to define function f. Using the first pair of values from the table, x = -27 and g(x) = 3, yields 3 = f(-27)/(-27 + 3), or 3 = f(-27)/(-24). Multiplying each side of this equation by -24 yields -72 = f(-27), so the point (-27, -72) is on the graph of y = f(x). Using the second pair of values from the table, x = -9 and g(x) = 0, yields 0 = f(-9)/(-9 + 3), or 0 = f(-9)/(-6). Multiplying each side of this equation by -6 yields 0 = f(-9), so the point (-9, 0) is on the graph of y = f(x). Substituting (-27, -72) and (-9, 0) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in the formula m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) yields m = (0 - (-72))/(-9 - (-27)), or m = 4. Substituting 4 for m in the equation f(x) = mx + b yields f(x) = 4x + b. Since 0 = f(-9), substituting -9 for x and 0 for f(x) in the equation f(x) = 4x + b yields 0 = 4(-9) + b, or 0 = -36 + b. Adding 36 to both sides of this equation yields 36 = b. It follows that 36 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept (0, b) of the graph of y = f(x). Therefore, the y-intercept of the graph of y = f(x) is (0, 36).",

                    "Rationale": "It's given that in triangle ABC, point D on side AB is connected by a line segment with point E on side AC such that line segment DE is parallel to side BC. It follows that parallel segments DE and BC are intersected by sides AB and AC. If two parallel segments are intersected by a third segment, corresponding angles are congruent. Thus, corresponding angles C and AED are congruent and corresponding angles B and ADE are congruent. Since triangle ADE has two angles that are each congruent to an angle in triangle ABC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by the angle-angle similarity postulate, where side DE corresponds to side BC, and side AE corresponds to side AC. Since the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional, it follows that DE/BC = AE/AC. Since point E lies on side AC, AE + CE = AC. It's given that CE = 2AE. Substituting 2AE for CE in the equation AE + CE = AC yields AE + 2AE = AC, or 3AE = AC. It's given that BC = 162. Substituting 162 for BC and 3AE for AC in the equation DE/BC = AE/AC yields DE/162 = AE/(3AE), or DE/162 = 1/3. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 162 yields DE = 54. Thus, the length of line segment DE is 54.",
