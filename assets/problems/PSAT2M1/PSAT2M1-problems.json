Given two points on a line, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), the slope of the line can be calculated using the equation m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Substituting the points (0, -6) and (9, 0) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in this equation yields m = (0 - (-6))/(9 - 0), which is equivalent to m = 6/9, or m = 2/3.

Two lines are distinct and parallel if they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. Each equation in the given system can be written in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line representing the equation in the xy-plane and (0, b) is the y-intercept. Adding 12x to both sides of the first equation in the given system of equations, -12x + 14y = 36, yields 14y = 12x + 36. Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 yields y = 6x/7 + 18/7. It follows that the first equation in the given system of equations has a slope of 6/7 and a y-intercept of (0, 18/7). Adding 6x to both sides of the second equation in the given system of equations, -6x + 7y = -18, yields 7y = 6x - 18. Dividing both sides of this equation by 7 yields y = 6x/7 - 18/7. It follows that the second equation in the given system of equations has a slope of 6/7 and a y-intercept of (0, -18/7). Since the slopes of these lines are the same and the y-intercepts are different, it follows that the given system of equations has zero solutions.\nAlternate approach: To solve the system by elimination, multiplying the second equation in the given system of equations, -6x + 7y = -18, by -2 yields 12x - 14y = 36. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system of equations, -12x + 14y = 36, yields (-12x + 12x) + (-14y + 14y) = 36 + 36, or 0 = 72. Since this equation isn't true, the given system of equations has zero solutions.",

Substituting (0, 6) and (2, 0) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in this equation yields m = (0 - 6)/(2 - 0), which is equivalent to m = -6/2, or m = -3. Since (0, 6) is the y-intercept, it follows that b = 6. Substituting -3 for m and 6 for b in the equation y = mx + b yields y = -3x + 6. Adding 3x to both sides of this equation yields 3x + y = 6.

                    "Rationale": "Let x represent the total mass, in grams, of the first piece, and let y represent the total mass, in grams, of the second piece. It's given that the sample has a total mass of 50.0 grams. Therefore, the equation x + y = 50.0. represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is 50.0% silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is 0.500(50.0), or 25.0, grams. It's also given that the first piece was 30.0% silicon by mass and the second piece was 80.0% silicon by mass. Therefore, the masses, in grams, of the silicon in the first and second pieces can be represented by the expressions 0.300x and 0.800y, respectively. Since the sample was created by combining the first and second pieces, and the total mass of the silicon in the sample is 25.0 grams, the equation 0.300x + 0.800y = 25.0 represents this situation. Subtracting y from both sides of the equation x + y = 50.0 yields x = 50.0 - y. Substituting 50.0 - y for x in the equation 0.300x + 0.800y = 25.0 yields 0.300(50.0 - y) + 0.800y = 25.0. Distributing 0.300 on the left-hand side of this equation yields 15.0 - 0.300y + 0.800y = 25.0. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields 15.0 + 0.500y = 25.0. Subtracting 15.0 from both sides of this equation yields 0.500y = 10.0. Dividing both sides of this equation by 0.500 yields y = 20.0. Substituting 20.0 for y in the expression representing the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece, 0.800y, yields 0.800(20.0), or 16.0. Therefore, the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece is 16.0.",

                    "Rationale": "Let x represent the first integer and y represent the second integer. If the first integer is 5 greater than twice the second integer, then x = 2y + 5. It's given that the product of the two integers is 462; therefore xy = 462. Substituting 2y + 5 for x in this equation yields (2y + 5)(y) = 462, which can be written as 2y² + 5y = 462. Subtracting 462 from each side of this equation yields 2y² + 5y - 462 = 0. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is 2(-462), or -924, and whose sum is 5. The two values whose product is -924 and whose sum is 5 are 33 and -28. Thus, the equation 2y² + 5y - 462 = 0 can be rewritten as 2y² - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0, which is equivalent to 2y(y - 14) + 33(y - 14) = 0, or (2y + 33)(y - 14) = 0. By the zero product property, it follows that 2y + 33 = 0 or y - 14 = 0. Subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation 2y + 33 = 0 yields 2y = -33. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields y = -33/2. Since y is a positive integer, the value of y isn't -33/2. Adding 14 to both sides of the equation y - 14 = 0 yields y = 14. Substituting 14 for y in the equation xy = 462 yields x(14) = 462. Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 yields x = 33. Therefore, the two integers are 14 and 33, so the smaller of the two integers is 14.",
