Given two points on a line, `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, the slope of the line can be calculated using the equation `m=(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)`.

Substituting `2/3` for `m` and `-6` for `b` in the equation `y=mx+b` yields `y=2/3x-6` as the equation of the boundary line.

                    "Rationale": "A system of two linear equations in two variables, `x` and `y`, has zero solutions if the lines representing the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. Two lines are distinct and parallel if they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. Each equation in the given system can be written in slope-intercept form `y=mx+b`, where `m` is the slope of the line representing the equation in the xy-plane and `(0,b)` is the y-intercept. Adding `12x` to both sides of the first equation in the given system of equations, `-12x+14y=36`, yields `14y=12x+36`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `14` yields `y=6/7x+18/7`. It follows that the first equation in the given system of equations has a slope of `6/7` and a y-intercept of `(0,18/7)`. Adding `6x` to both sides of the second equation in the given system of equations, `-6x+7y=-18`, yields `7y=6x-18`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `7` yields `y=6/7x-18/7`. It follows that the second equation in the given system of equations has a slope of `6/7` and a y-intercept of `(0,-18/7)`. Since the slopes of these lines are the same and the y-intercepts are different, it follows that the given system of equations has zero solutions.\n\nAlternate approach: To solve the system by elimination, multiplying the second equation in the given system of equations, `-6x+7y=-18`, by `-2` yields `12x-14y=36`. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system of equations, `-12x+14y=36`, yields `(-12x+12x)+(-14y+14y)=36+36`, or `0=72`. Since this equation isn't true, the given system of equations has zero solutions.",

                    "Rationale": "Let `x` represent the total mass, in `text(grams)`, of the first piece, and let `y` represent the total mass, in `text(grams)`, of the second piece. It's given that the sample has a total mass of `50.0text( grams)`. Therefore, the equation `x+y=50.0`. represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is `50.0%` silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is `0.500(50.0)`, or `25.0`, `text(grams)`. It's also given that the first piece was `30.0%` silicon by mass and the second piece was `80.0%` silicon by mass. Therefore, the masses, in `text(grams)`, of the silicon in the first and second pieces can be represented by the expressions `0.300x` and `0.800y`, respectively. Since the sample was created by combining the first and second pieces, and the total mass of the silicon in the sample is `25.0text( grams)`, the equation `0.300x+0.800y=25.0` represents this situation. Subtracting `y` from both sides of the equation `x+y=50.0` yields `x=50.0-y`. Substituting `50.0-y` for `x` in the equation `0.300x+0.800y=25.0` yields `0.300(50.0-y)+0.800y=25.0`. Distributing `0.300` on the left-hand side of this equation yields `15.0-0.300y+0.800y=25.0`. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields `15.0+0.500y=25.0`. Subtracting `15.0` from both sides of this equation yields `0.500y=10.0`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `0.500` yields `y=20.0`. Substituting `20.0` for `y` in the expression representing the mass, in `text(grams)`, of the silicon in the second piece, `0.800y`, yields `0.800(20.0)`, or `16.0`.

                    "Rationale": "Let `x` represent the first integer and `y` represent the second integer. If the first integer is `5` greater than twice the second integer, then `x=2y+5`. It's given that the product of the two integers is `462`; therefore `xy=462`. Substituting `2y+5` for `x` in this equation yields `(2y+5)(y)=462`, which can be written as `2y^2+5y=462`. Subtracting `462` from each side of this equation yields `2y^2+5y-462=0`. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is `2(-462)`, or `-924`, and whose sum is `5`. The two values whose product is `-924` and whose sum is `5` are `33` and `-28`. Thus, the equation `2y^2+5y-462=0` can be rewritten as `2y^2-28y+33y-462=0`, which is equivalent to `2y(y-14)+33(y-14)=0`, or `(2y+33)(y-14)=0`. By the zero product property, it follows that `2y+33=0` or `y-14=0`. Subtracting `33` from both sides of the equation `2y+33=0` yields `2y=-33`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `2` yields `y=-33/2`. Since `y` is a positive integer, the value of `y` isn't `-33/2`. Adding `14` to both sides of the equation `y-14=0` yields `y=14`. Substituting `14` for `y` in the equation `xy=462` yields `x(14)=462`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `14` yields `x=33`. Therefore, the two integers are `14` and `33`, so the smaller of the two integers is `14`.",
