The area of a rectangle is equal to its width multiplied by its length. Multiplying the width, x inches, by the length, 7x - 4 inches, yields x(7x - 4) square inches. It's given that the rectangle has an area of 155 square inches, so it follows that x(7x - 4) = 155, or 7x^2- 4x = 155. Subtracting 155 from both sides of this equation yields 7x^2- 4x - 155 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields (7x + 31)(x - 5). Applying the zero product property to this equation yields two solutions: x = -31/7 and x = 5. Since x is the rectangle's width, in inches, which must be positive, the value of x is 5. Therefore, the width of the rectangle, in inches, is 5.",

It follows that this relationship can be represented by an equation of the form p = mc + b, where m is the rate of change of p in this relationship and b is a constant. The rate of change of p in this relationship can be calculated by dividing the difference in any two values of p by the difference in the corresponding values of c. Using two pairs of values given in the table, the rate of change of p in this relationship is (284 - 174)/(5 - 3), or 55. Substituting 55 for m in the equation p = mc + b yields p = 55c + b. The value of b can be found by substituting any value of c and its corresponding value of p for c and p, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 10 for c and 559 for p yields 559 = 55(10) + b, or 559 = 550 + b. Subtracting 550 from both sides of this equation yields 9 = b. Substituting 9 for b in the equation p = 55c + b yields p = 55c + 9. Subtracting 9 from both sides of this equation yields p - 9 = 55c. Subtracting p from both sides of this equation yields -9 = 55c - p, or 55c - p = -9.",

Substituting -24 for x and 0 for f(x) in the equation f(x) = a√(x + b) yields 0 = a√(-24 + b). By the zero product property, either a = 0 or √(-24 + b) = 0.

                    "Rationale": "'s given that points A and B lie on the circle with center C. Therefore, AC and BC are both radii of the circle. Since all radii of a circle are congruent, AC is congruent to BC. The length of AC, or the distance from point A to point C, can be found using the distance formula, which gives the distance between two points, `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, as √((x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2). Substituting the given coordinates of point A, (h + 1, k + √102) for `(x_1,y_1)` and the given coordinates of point C, `(h,k)`, for `(x_2,y_2)` in the distance formula yields √((h + 1 - h)^2 + (k + √102 - k)^2), or √(1^2 + (√102)^2), which is equivalent to √(1 + 102), or √103. Therefore, the length of AC is √103 and the length of BC is √103. It's given that angle ACB is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ACB is a right triangle with legs AC and BC and hypotenuse AB. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b, then `a^2+b^2=c^2`. Substituting √103 for a and b in this equation yields (√103)^2 + (√103)^2 = c², or 103 + 103 = c², which is equivalent to 206 = c². Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields √206 = c. Therefore, the length of AB is √206.",

The line of best fit shown for data set E has a `text(y)`-intercept at approximately (0, 12). It's given that data set F is created by multiplying the `text(y)`-coordinate of each data point from data set E by 3.9. It follows that a line of best fit for data set F has a `text(y)`-intercept at approximately (0, 12(3.9)) or (0, 46.8). Therefore, the value of a is approximately 46.8. The slope of a line that passes through points `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)` can be calculated as `(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)`. Since the line of best fit shown for data set E passes approximately through the point (12, 30), it follows that a line of best fit for data set F passes approximately through the point (12, 30(3.9)), or (12, 117). Substituting (0, 46.8) and (12, 117) for `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, respectively, in `(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)` yields (117 - 46.8)/(12 - 0), which is equivalent to 70.2/12, or 5.85. Therefore, the value of b is approximately 5.85, or approximately 5.9. Thus, y = 46.8 + 5.9x could be an equation of a line of best fit for data set F.",
