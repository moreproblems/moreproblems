Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields (7x + 31)(x - 5). Applying the zero product property to this equation yields two solutions: x = -31/7 and x = 5.

It’s given that a right circular cylinder has a volume of 432 cubic centimeters and the area of the base is 24 square centimeters. Substituting 432 for V and 24 for πr² in the formula V = πr²h yields 432 = 24h. Dividing both sides of this equation by 24 yields 18 = h. Therefore, the height of the cylinder, in centimeters, is 18.",

It follows that this relationship can be represented by an equation of the form p = mc + b, where m is the rate of change of p in this relationship and b is a constant. The rate of change of p in this relationship can be calculated by dividing the difference in any two values of p by the difference in the corresponding values of c. Using two pairs of values given in the table, the rate of change of p in this relationship is (284 - 174)/(5 - 3), or 55. Substituting 55 for m in the equation p = mc + b yields p = 55c + b. The value of b can be found by substituting any value of c and its corresponding value of p for c and p, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 10 for c and 559 for p yields 559 = 55(10) + b, or 559 = 550 + b. Subtracting 550 from both sides of this equation yields 9 = b. Substituting 9 for b in the equation p = 55c + b yields p = 55c + 9. Subtracting 9 from both sides of this equation yields p - 9 = 55c. Subtracting p from both sides of this equation yields -9 = 55c - p, or 55c - p = -9.",

Since all radii of a circle are congruent, AC is congruent to BC. The length of AC, or the distance from point A to point C, can be found using the distance formula, which gives the distance between two points, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), as √((x₁ - x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²).Substituting the given coordinates of point A, (h + 1, k + √102) for (x₁, y₁) and the given coordinates of point C, (h, k), for (x₂, y₂) in the distance formula yields √((h + 1 - h)² + (k + √102 - k)²), or √(1² + (√102)²), which is equivalent to √(1 + 102), or √103. Therefore, the length of AC is √103 and the length of BC is √103. It’s given that angle ACB is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ACB is a right triangle with legs AC and BC and hypotenuse AB. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b, then a² + b² = c². Substituting √103 for a and b in this equation yields (√103)² + (√103)² = c², or 103 + 103 = c², which is equivalent to 206 = c². Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields √206 = c. Therefore, the length of AB is √206.",

The line of best fit shown for data set E has a y-intercept at approximately (0, 12). It’s given that data set F is created by multiplying the y-coordinate of each data point from data set E by 3.9. It follows that a line of best fit for data set F has a y-intercept at approximately (0, 12(3.9)) or (0, 46.8). Therefore, the value of a is approximately 46.8. The slope of a line that passes through points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) can be calculated as (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Since the line of best fit shown for data set E passes approximately through the point (12, 30), it follows that a line of best fit for data set F passes approximately through the point (12, 30(3.9)), or (12, 117). Substituting (0, 46.8) and (12, 117) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) yields (117 - 46.8)/(12 - 0), which is equivalent to 70.2/12, or 5.85. Therefore, the value of b is approximately 5.85, or approximately 5.9. Thus, y = 46.8 + 5.9x could be an equation of a line of best fit for data set F.",

The first equation in the given system, 48x - 64y = 48y + 24, can be written in the form Ax + By = C by subtracting 48y from both sides of the equation to yield 48x - 112y = 24.

The coefficient of x in the second equation is 1/4 times the coefficient of x in the first equation. That is, 48(1/4) = 12. For the lines to be parallel, the coefficient of y in the second equation must also be 1/4 times the coefficient of y in the first equation. Therefore, -112(1/4) = r, or -28 = r.
