It's given that the length of the rectangle is `4` `text(inches)` less than `7` times its width, or `7x-4` `text(inches)`. The area of a rectangle is equal to its width multiplied by its length. Multiplying the width, `x` `text(inches)`, by the length, `7x - 4` `text(inches)`, yields `x(7x - 4)` `text(square inches)`. It's given that the rectangle has an area of `155` `text(square inches)`, so it follows that `x(7x-4)=155`, or `7x^2-4x=155`. Subtracting `155` from both sides of this equation yields `7x^2-4x-155=0`. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields `(7x+31)(x-5)`. Applying the zero product property to this equation yields two solutions: `x=-31/7` and `x=5`. Since `x` is the rectangle's width, in `text(inches)`, which must be positive, the value of `x` is `5`.

It follows that this relationship can be represented by an equation of the form `p=mc+b`, where `m` is the rate of change of `p` in this relationship and `b` is a constant. The rate of change of `p` in this relationship can be calculated by dividing the difference in any two values of `p` by the difference in the corresponding values of `c`. Using two pairs of values given in the table, the rate of change of `p` in this relationship is `(284-174)/(5-3)`, or `55`. Substituting `55` for `m` in the equation `p=mc+b` yields `p=55c+b`. The value of `b` can be found by substituting any value of `c` and its corresponding value of `p` for `c` and `p`, respectively, in this equation. Substituting `10` for `c` and `559` for `p` yields `559=55(10)+b`, or `559=550+b`. Subtracting `550` from both sides of this equation yields `9=b`. Substituting `9` for `b` in the equation `p=55c+b` yields `p=55c+9`. Subtracting `9` from both sides of this equation yields `p-9=55c`. Subtracting `p` from both sides of this equation yields `-9=55c-p`, or `55c-p=-9`.",

                    "Rationale": "It's given that points `A` and `B` lie on the circle with center `C`. Therefore, `AC` and `BC` are both radii of the circle. Since all radii of a circle are congruent, `AC` is congruent to `BC`. The length of `AC`, or the distance from point `A` to point `C`, can be found using the distance formula, which gives the distance between two points, `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)`, as `sqrt((x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2)`. Substituting the given coordinates of point `A`, `(h+1,k+sqrt(102))` for `(x_1,y_1)` and the given coordinates of point `C`, `(h,k)`, for `(x_2,y_2)` in the distance formula yields `sqrt((h+1-h)^2+(k+sqrt(102)-k)^2)`, or `sqrt(1^2+(sqrt(102))^2)`, which is equivalent to `sqrt(1+102)`, or `sqrt(103)`. Therefore, the length of `AC` is `sqrt(103)` and the length of `BC` is `sqrt(103)`. It's given that angle `ACB` is a right angle. Therefore, triangle `ACB` is a right triangle with legs `AC` and `BC` and hypotenuse `AB`. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length `c` and legs with lengths `a` and `b`, then `a^2+b^2=c^2`. Substituting `sqrt(103)` for `a` and `b` in this equation yields `(sqrt(103))^2+(sqrt(103))^2=c^2`, or `103+103=c^2`, which is equivalent to `206=c^2`. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields `sqrt(206)=c`. Therefore, the length of `AB` is `sqrt(206)`.",

The line of best fit shown for data set `E` has a `y`-intercept at approximately `(0,12)`. It's given that data set `F` is created by multiplying the `y`-coordinate of each data point from data set `E` by `3.9`. It follows that a line of best fit for data set `F` has a `y`-intercept at approximately `(0,12(3.9))` or `(0,46.8)`. Therefore, the value of `a` is approximately `46.8`. The slope of a line that passes through points `(x_1,y_1)` and `(x_2,y_2)` can be calculated as `(y_2-y_1)/(x_2-x_1)`. Since the line of best fit shown for data set `E` passes approximately through the point `(12,30)`, it follows that a line of best fit for data set `F` passes approximately through the point `(12,30(3.9))`, or `(12,117)`.
