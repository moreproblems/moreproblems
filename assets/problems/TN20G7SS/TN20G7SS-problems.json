            ":box:Most historians point to Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543) and his novel [original] ideas regarding the movement of the earth as the starting point of the Scientific Revolution. In the early 1500s, Copernicus, through study and reasoning, concluded that the earth and planets revolved around the sun. This heliocentric (sun-centered) theory was in stark contrast to the traditional geocentric (earth-centered) theory. For over a thousand years people had believed the Church's teachings that the earth was the center of the universe ... In the Middle Ages, scholars ... placed the earth at the center of the universe ...\n\nJohannes Kepler (1571 – 1630), a mathematician, supported the Copernican theory by demonstrating with his calculations that the planets did, indeed, move around the sun. About the same time, the brilliant Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642) challenged the Church's geocentric teachings. Galileo constructed a telescope, observed the heavens, and noted that Jupiter had four moons revolving around it — thus not everything revolved around Earth as believed. He also observed that the moon's surface was rough and uneven, not smooth and unblemished as Aristotle had proposed ...\n\nThe steps taken by Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo eventually evolved into what we call the scientific method. The scientific method involves posing a question, formulating a hypothesis, performing experiments, and analyzing the results. Reason, mathematics, and observation — the steps used by Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo in proving the heliocentric theory — are integral parts of this method.\n\n\t —  Sara Drogin, A Short History of Western Civilization",

            ":box:Article 1: Whether it is necessary to have another doctrine besides the philosophical disciplines.\n\nLet us proceed to the first point. It seems that there is no necessity for any doctrine beyond the philosophical disciplines. Man should not strive after that which is beyond his reason ...\n\nThere are diverse sciences because things can be known in various ways. For example, the astronomer and the natural philosopher both demonstrate the same conclusion, such as that the world is round; yet the astronomer does so through mathematics, while the natural philosopher does so in a way that takes matter into account. Thus there is no reason why those things treated by the philosophical disciplines through natural reason should not also be treated by another science insofar as they are known by the light of divine revelation. Thus the theology which pertains to sacred doctrine differs from that theology which is a part of philosophy.\n\n\t —  Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, 1273",
