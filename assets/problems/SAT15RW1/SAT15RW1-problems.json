She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people “are moral beings” (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have “rights and responsibilities” (line 68).

The questions in lines 74-78 highlight and expand on that result, making it clear that it is surprising to find that the mental athletes use images to remember numbers or use a part of the brain associated with navigation when trying to remember shapes. Although it became clear how the mental athletes were memorizing things, it was not clear why they were doing it that way.",
