Next to the road was a sign that said “Panther Crossing.” The Florida panther is an endangered species. There are fewer than 80 panthers left in the Everglades. I kept my eyes open. And was I ever amazed by what I saw that day in the Everglades!"],

We stayed quiet, and they didn't seem afraid. It seemed to me that nothing in the Everglades feared us."],
        [" ", "\tThose barred owl babies were just a preview of what awaited us at the swamp where the boardwalk ended. Cypress forests are the perfect habitat for water-loving animals. Here's why: These trees grow in water! Sticking up from the water around the base of the trees are “knees,” which are actually part of the roots. And they're “home sweet home” for water creatures that like to hide. Higher up, wading birds nest in the branches."],

In the water below us was a huge mother alligator with, yes, nine babies crawling on and around her. They were about the size of my feet and really cute! I also spotted a water snake swimming under a cypress tree. And this was just our first stop!"],

        [" ", "\tThese mammals are huge (they're sometimes called “sea cows”). They hang out close to the water's surface, where they are often hit by speeding boats. Many manatees die from these accidents; many others bear huge scars from propellers. I kept my eyes open but didn't see any manatees: the water was too brown to see anything in it."],
        [" ", "\tThe water isn't brown because it's polluted—it's naturally brown. Here's why: The 10,000 islands are covered with mangrove trees, whose roots reach into the brackish (a mixture of salty and fresh) water. These trees—and their roots—are a great habitat for many animals, both in and out of the water. When the leaves fall into the water, they break down, turning the water brown and becoming food for tiny organisms. Those organisms are eaten by bigger animals like crabs and fish, which are eaten by even bigger animals like birds and..."],

He told us that much of the water we had followed from the River of Grass through the swamps and to the ocean is being drained. People are drying out the land to build houses and farms. Sometimes water is allowed to rush back into drained areas. When this happens, alligator eggs are often washed from their nests. Many animals that depend on the Everglades are losing their homes."],
