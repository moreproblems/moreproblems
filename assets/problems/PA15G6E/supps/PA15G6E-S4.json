A tiny part of each person's brain controls at what time of the day you'll feel wide awake and what time you'll feel sleepy."],
        [" ", "\tPeople call this part of the brain the biological clock or the body clock. Of course, it's not really a clock. It's actually two tiny clumps of nerve cells—about the size of two pinheads— inside your brain. The real name of these clumps of cells is the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SOO-pra-ki-az-MAT-ik NOO-klee-i), or the SCN for short. They help your brain produce the right chemicals, called neurotransmitters and hormones, to make you feel sleepy as bedtime gets nearer and ready to rise as morning approaches."],

        [" ", "\tDuring the day, your biological clock triggers your body to produce chemicals that stimulate your brain and keep it alert. While it's alert, a part of your brain stem—the lower part of your brain that looks after breathing and other basic life functions—is hard at work. It passes information nonstop from your senses to your cerebral cortex—the upper part of your brain that sorts out information from your senses and controls speech and all your other muscle movements."],
        [" ", "\tLater, your biological clock signals your body that bedtime is approaching. When the daylight begins to fade, your pineal gland churns out more melatonin, a hormone that lets your organs know it's time for sleep. Your brain starts producing less of the stimulating, wake-up chemicals. Eventually, another part of the brain stem (the pontine nuclei) takes over, allowing you to sleep. Once this part is in charge, very little sensory information is passed to your cerebral cortex and you are no longer as aware of things around you."],

Scientists have discovered that over the course of each day, human beings (and other animals, too) have a distinct pattern of times when they are sleepy and times when they are alert. Most people feel energetic in the morning, then start to feel sleepy after lunch. They perk up in late afternoon, feel wide awake right after supper and then get tired at bedtime. This sleep/wake cycle is part of a larger, 24-hour pattern called the circadian rhythm."],
        [" ", "\tSome other events in your day are part of your circadian rhythm as well. For example, your body temperature rises just before you wake up and falls during the night. And your stomach produces digestive juices according to a schedule, so that at meal times it's ready to break down the food you eat."],

Eating and exercising at regular times, even brushing your teeth and putting on your pajamas before bed can signal your brain that everything is happening when it's supposed to. But the most important time clue for your biological clock is daylight."],
        [" ", "\tWhen your eyes sense light, optical fibers carry the message to your brain and your SCN. As long as your eyes are sensing bright light during the day and no light at night, your biological clock knows that it's waking you up, making you sleepy, and triggering all those other events at the correct times."],

        [" ", "\tIf you switched night for day and day for night long enough, your body might get used to the change. The problem is that most shift workers don't stick to the new schedule for long, so their bodies don't have time to adjust. As a result shift workers often feel sleepy at work, but lie awake in bed when they're supposed to be sleeping."],

The more time zones you cross, the more out of whack your biological clock gets. Your brain may produce chemicals that keep you wide awake when everyone else is asleep. It can take a week before daylight resets your clock and gets all the systems of your circadian rhythm back to normal."],

So the melatonin signal is weaker, and they don't feel sleepy until well after midnight. Getting up is a nightmare, and they drag themselves around exhausted for the rest of the day. By evening, they're wide awake again and can't get to sleep. To deal with the problem of sleepy teens, some U.S. high schools are starting classes later in the morning so that students can get the sleep they need."],

Although the sleeper's eyeballs didn't roll, from time to time they darted very quickly back and forth under closed eyelids. What Kleitman and Aserinsky had discovered was a special stage of sleep. They named it Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep and soon found that it's during REM sleep that sleepers have their most elaborate dreams."],

The brainwaves during this stage are a little larger and slower than at Stage 1. From there you sink into the deeper sleep of Stages 3 and 4. Your body is very relaxed and it is difficult to wake you. During Stage 4, your body produces the largest amount of some of the chemicals that help you grow."],
