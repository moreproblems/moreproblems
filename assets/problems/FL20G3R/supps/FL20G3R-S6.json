        ["2", "\tSome animals have thick fur coats to keep them warm. Others bury themselves in cozy little holes. What scientists don’t know is whether animals feel cold in the same way that humans do. They were c͟u͟r͟i͟o͟s to learn more."],
        ["3", "\tOne scientist made a test. She set up two paths for squirrels to choose between. The first path was w͟a͟r͟m than the second path. In fact, the second path was freezing cold! She found that the squirrels moved along both paths but seemed to like the first path best. The scientist believes that animals do feel the cold, but they may not feel it as much as humans do."]
