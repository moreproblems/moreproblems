        [" ", "\tHave you ever seen an animated movie or television show that looks like everything has been made out of clay? This technique using clay figurines and objects is called “claymation,” or stop-motion animation, and was first seen as early as 1902 in Georges Méliès's film A Trip to the Moon. From that point, filmmakers around the world began to explore and grasp this technique, and in recent years this art form has become quite popular with films."],
        [" ", "\tMaking a film like this is somewhat similar to drawing a flipbook. If you were to draw a flipbook of a person waving his hand, there would be only slight, minor changes in the position of the hand on each page. When the pages are flipped through in one simultaneous motion, it gives the illusion of the character raising his arm to wave “hello.”"],
        [" ", "\tThe techniques behind stop-motion film are very similar, except oftentimes filmmakers will use figures made entirely out of clay and will use a camera to capture their footage rather than a pencil and paper. In order to begin, they must first come up with a concept as to what they want the film to be about. They will then mold their characters and the entire world of the film using clay. Then they will move and manipulate each figure to create the illusion of movement. Each object is moved slowly and then recorded on film. After shooting one or two frames of film, the camera is paused and the object is moved again. Each character or object is moved extremely slowly, the movement being almost invisible to the naked eye. Objects are moved slowly to create fluid, realistic movements and faster to create swifter, jerkier movements. Sometimes this process of creating a claymation film can take years."],
        [" ", "\tAlthough making a film this way may seem difficult, don't let appearances be deceiving. With the right supplies and a lot of patience, you, too, can make your very own short claymation film."],
