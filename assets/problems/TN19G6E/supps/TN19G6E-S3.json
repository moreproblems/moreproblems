        [" ", "\tThe kingfisher was a beautiful bird, and he was very proud. He had smooth, blue feathers and a black beak. All day he sat by the marsh alone, watching for fish. [When he caught a fish, he plucked them from the water in one] quick movement."],
        [" ", "\tA group of crows also fished in the marsh. Each morning, [the crows talking loudly among themselves] about where the best fish were."],
        [" ", "\t[“The crows are loud, but the crows are not like me, and I am quiet and beautiful,”] thought the kingfisher. “I don’t need a group of strange, annoying birds to fish.”"],
        [" ", "\tAs fall arrived, the fish swam away from the marsh and into the big river. The waters of the marsh were silent and still. [One crow noticed. She told the others.] The crows discussed this and decided to fly farther up the river."],
        [" ", "\t“Kingfisher, come with us. You’ll be hungry by this marsh,” they said. The kingfisher proudly turned away his gorgeous head, and the crows departed. In the river, the crows discovered an abundance of fish."],
        [" ", "\tThe kingfisher grew hungrier and hungrier. Finally, he flew toward the river. The [crows, who were full and happy, let] the kingfisher catch his fill."],
        [" ", "\tSince that time, the kingfisher is still a quiet bird, but he listens to the birds around him."]
