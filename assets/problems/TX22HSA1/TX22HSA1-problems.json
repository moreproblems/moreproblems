To find the equation for line h, the student could have used the first two sets of values in the table and applied the slope formula m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ −x₁), resulting in m = (1 − 7)/(−8 − (−16)) = (−6)/8 = −3/4. To determine the y-intercept of line h, the student could have substituted the slope and one of the ordered pairs from the table, (−16, 7), into the point-slope equation, y – y₁ = m(x – x₁), where m represents the slope of the line and (x₁, y₁) represents a point on the line. The student could have obtained y − 7 = (−3/4)(x − (−16)) and then solved for y, by first distributing the −3/4, resulting in y − 7 = (−3/4)x − 12. Next, the student could have added 7 to both sides to isolate the y, resulting in the equation y = (−3/4)x − 5. To find the equation of line j, which is represented by a graph, the student could have used the slope-intercept form of a line, y = mx + b. The student could have first located the y-intercept at (0, 1) and identified that b = 1.

To graph the first inequality, the student could have isolated the y on one side of the inequality and subtracted x from both sides of the inequality, resulting in 2y < −x – 2. Next, the student could have divided both sides of the inequality by 2, to obtain y < (−1/2)x − 1. The boundary line for this inequality, y = (−1/2)x − 1, will cross the y-axis (vertical axis) at the point (0, −1) and will have a slope (steepness of a straight line graphed on a coordinate grid; m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ −x₁)) of m = −1/2. The student could have then determined that the “<” symbol means “less than,” indicating that the boundary line is represented by a dashed line. Next, to determine where to shade, the student could have used the test point (0, 0) to determine which half-plane represents the solution to the inequality. Substituting (0, 0) into the original inequality, the student could have obtained (0) + 2(0) < −2 and then simplified, resulting in 0 < −2. Since this statement is not true, the student could have concluded that the solution set for the inequality x + 2y < −2 is the half-plane that does not contain (0, 0) and does not include the points on the boundary line.\nFor the second inequality, y – x < 3, the student could have added x to both sides of the inequality to obtain y < x + 3. The boundary line for this inequality will cross the y-axis at the point (0, 3) and will have a slope of 1. The student could have then determined that the “<” symbol means “less than,” indicating that the boundary line is represented by a dashed line. Next, to determine where to shade, the student could have used the test point (0, 0) to determine which half-plane represents the solution to the inequality. Substituting (0, 0) into the original inequality, the student could have obtained (0) – (0) < 3 and then simplified, resulting in 0 < 3. Since this statement is true, the student could have concluded that the solution set for the inequality y – x < 3 is the half-plane that contains (0, 0) and does not include the points on the boundary line. Finally, the student could have verified the region where the shaded half-planes overlap.

Slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m represents the slope (steepness of a straight line graphed on a coordinate grid; m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ −x₁)) of each line and b represents the y-intercept (value where a line crosses the y-axis) of each line. To rewrite the first equation, 2x = 6 – y, the student could have first added y to both sides of the equation, obtaining 2x + y = 6. Next, the student could have subtracted 2x from both sides, resulting in the equation y = −2x + 6. Next, for the first equation, the student could have recognized that the graph of the line will cross the y-axis (vertical axis) at the point (0, 6) and will have a slope (steepness of a straight line graphed on a coordinate grid; m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ −x₁)) of −2. To find the slope-intercept form of the second equation, 5x – 4y = 28, the student could first have subtracted 5x from both sides, resulting in −4y = −5x + 28. Next, the student could have divided both sides of the equation by −4, obtaining the equation y = (5/4)x − 7. Finally, the student could have recognized that the graph of the line will cross the y-axis (vertical axis) at (0, −7) and will have a slope (steepness of a straight line graphed on a coordinate grid; m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ −x₁)) of 5/4.

Since it is given that the initial value of the house is $200,000, the student could have recognized that the value of a is 200,000. Since the value of the home increases at a rate of 6% per year, the student could have understood that the common factor, b, will be 1 + 0.06, or b = 1.06. Substituting these values into the exponential function y = ab⁵ˣ, the student could have obtained the result y = 200,000(1.06)⁵ˣ, where x represents the time in years. The student then could have calculated the value of the function when x = 5, resulting in y = 200,000(1.06)⁵.
