Why green? Plants are green, and without them the Earth wouldn't be such a lovely home for us human beings."],
        [" ", "\tEvery day, people make choices that affect the amount of trash and pollution that gets produced in our world. What can you do? A whole lot, actually. Here's a four-step guide to being green:"],

        ["2.", "Reuse stuff when you can."],
        ["3.", "Recycle cans, bottles, paper, books, and even toys."],

        [" ", "\tWhen you use less of something, you do a good thing for the Earth. For instance, a shorter shower means you used less water and less fuel since your house uses fuel to run the water heater that warmed up the water."],

        ["•", "Turn off lights you're not using. Better yet, encourage adults to switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs. They last longer and use less energy. They do need to be disposed of properly, though, so make sure your mom or dad helps if one breaks."],
        ["•", "When you can, walk or ride your bike instead of driving in the car. You'll use less gas — and get some exercise!"],

        [" ", "\tSometimes people call ours a “throwaway society.” That means that we're a little too willing to throw away old stuff and buy new stuff. Many times, even if you no longer need something, someone else just might. For instance, if your baby brother outgrows his plastic basketball hoop, why not give it to another family who has a little kid? That's one less plastic basketball set that they need to buy. It's also one less large plastic toy that needs to be produced, packaged, and shipped to the toy store."],

        ["•", "Take your own bags — preferably reusable ones — when you go to the grocery store."],
        ["•", "Drink tap water instead of buying bottled water. If you don't like how your tap water tastes, a low-cost filtration system could make a difference. Get a reusable water bottle so you can take it with you."],
        ["•", "Organize a swap among your friends. What can you swap? Books, toys, even clothes. It's a way for everyone to get something new without spending any money and without throwing a bunch of stuff away. Set aside some items for your swap when you're cleaning your room!"],

Tell your mom or dad you want to become “Chief of Recycling” for your household. That means you'll organize the recyclable items in bins, remember to put them on the curb on recycling day, and help remind others which items can be rinsed and recycled."],

A big mountain of trash, where all the trash trucks go to dump their loads. Recycled goods go instead to a recycling center, where they can be crushed, broken down, and later turned into new cans, bottles, and paper."],

If so, get out there and get your hands dirty.
