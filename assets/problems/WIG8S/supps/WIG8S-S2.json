        [" ", "Have you ever shuffled your feet along a carpeted floor and then touched another person—giving him or her a small electric shock? The shock is caused by static electricity. The production of static electricity can be magnified in a classroom or laboratory with a machine called a Van de Graaff generator."],

        [" ", "Each side of the rubber belt is charged differently. Positive charges are picked off the belt by the brush along the acrylic roller. These charges are transferred along the electrode and stored in the hollow metal sphere until discharge. The negative charges on the belt return to the metal roller at the bottom of the generator where they are picked off by the brush attached to the ground electrode. Discharge occurs when the negatively charged wand is brought close to the sphere and a spark is produced."],
        [" ", "Similarly, a person can discharge the generator. But safety is critical—the person must stand on an electrical insulator when discharging the metal sphere to avoid receiving an electric shock. The picture below shows a teacher demonstrating how discharging the Van de Graaff generator can make hair stand on end. That is hair-raising fun!"],
