This is because Iceland is a product of volcanic activity along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The map below shows the path of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge through Iceland and the location of the country’s major volcanoes."],

This divergence occurs as a result of convection in Earth’s mantle. New, hot magma rises through Earth’s mantle and escapes through cracks in Earth’s crust. When the magma cools, it forms new crust."]
