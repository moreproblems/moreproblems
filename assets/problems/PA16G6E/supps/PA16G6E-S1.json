Exercise can help some people sleep better. Plus, exercise can give people a real sense of accomplishment and pride at having achieved a certain goal—like beating an old time in the 100-meter dash.\n\n• Exᴇʀᴄɪsᴇ ᴄᴀɴ ʜᴇʟᴘ ʏᴏᴜ ꜰᴇᴇʟ ʙᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ. People who exercise burn more calories and are better toned than those who don't.

This may not seem important now, but your body will thank you later. Women are especially prone to a condition called osteoporosis (a weakening of the bones) as they get older.

When you give your heart this kind of workout regularly, it will get stronger and more e͟f͟f͟i͟c͟i͟e͟n͟t in delivering oxygen (in the form of oxygen-carrying blood cells) to all parts of your body."],
