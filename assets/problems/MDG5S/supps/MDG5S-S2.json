When the magnet was approximately 5 centimeters above the pile, a few paper clips moved off the table toward the bar magnet. The teacher raised the bar magnet so the students could observe that four steel paper clips were attached to each end of the magnet, as shown in the following diagram."],

To further investigate the student's question, an investigation using bar magnets held above objects made of various materials was conducted.

The students designed a second investigation where two magnets were pushed slowly toward each other, as shown in the following diagram."],
