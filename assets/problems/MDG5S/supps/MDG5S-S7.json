        [" ", "After reading about the solar-powered ovens, a student was curious about other technologies that help reduce carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. The student found a credible website that stated that power plants that produce electricity from fossil fuels are a major source of carbon dioxide emissions. Using wind turbines to produce electricity lessens the amount of electricity needed from plants powered by fossil fuels. The use of an average-sized wind turbine to produce electricity can avoid the production of over 3,300 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. That is equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from 500 cars in one year. The graph shows that from 2003 through 2013 the increasing use of electricity produced by wind power has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equal to taking 16.9 million cars off of the road."],
