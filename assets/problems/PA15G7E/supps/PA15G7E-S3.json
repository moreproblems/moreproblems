        [" ", "\tAs a busy working mother of five, I’m all about shortcuts. I consider myself close friends with Boxed Brownie Mix and occasionally hang out with her less-ambitious brother, Slice-and-Bake Cookie Dough."],
        [" ", "\tBut something bothers me about c͟o͟n͟s͟p͟i͟c͟u͟o͟u͟s͟l͟y store-bought goods on a bake-sale table. I don’t want to begrudge a busy mom who makes an emergency grocery run for some last-minute Chips Deluxe, but somehow, showing up with a platter of cake pops from a tony bakery feels more like showing off than taking it easy."],
        [" ", "\tAt the end of the day, most bake sales don’t bring in big bucks. Most likely the P.T.A. would be better off if you just handed them a $20 bill. When we choose to contribute to a bake sale, we’re not just doing it for the money but in order to share our time and have fun. There’s no point in participating only out of obligation, and there’s no fun in overshadowing a fellow mom’s homemade efforts with pricey treats."],
        [" ", "\tIf you’ve got money to burn and no interest in baking, write a check. Or use it to buy up everyone else’s homemade goods. I bet you’ll earn more points with other moms that way—and the organization will probably come out ahead, too."]
