Summer at Lea Hurst near the quaint village of Lea in Derbyshire, winter at fashionable Embley Park near Romsey. Surrounded by flowers and birds and servants. Ladies! Humph! Music and grammar, composition and modern languages. A lady must know Greek and Latin and mathematics and the antics of Caesar and Hannibal! It’s—it’s like lying on one’s back and having liquid poured down one’s throat. (Pauses for a moment to get her breath; picks up her sampler, looks at it scornfully as she speaks.) Embroidery! Like a bird in a gilded cage—like a fool I sit here sewing verses I don’t mean. (Reading from sampler.)"],

It can be such a simple thing, too. Why shouldn’t a soldier wear a clean shirt on the front as well as at home? And isn’t it more important that a sick man should eat food that is appetizing, like broths and jellies, rather than hunks of bread and raw meat?"],

(Stands, facing him and becomes very businesslike and brisk) Tell them that the supplies I stocked up on at Marseilles are running out. Tell them to stop this red tape³ which entwines all the official stores sent from England. Tell them men can’t wait for a Purveyor who in turn has to wait for a Board of Survey to examine goods sorely needed. Delay is maddening. We’re dealing with human lives. Human lives, Dr. Hall!"],

Tell them how these women work in the laundry, washing clothes. Tell them that before Miss Nightingale came only six shirts a month were washed. Tell them of the diet kitchen she set up. And tell them what fools we doctors were and how we opposed her every move."],

She would speak to one and nod and smile to many more, but she could not do it all, you know.
