        ["", "People often talk about the beauty of a sunset or sunrise. The Sun is able to inspire many feelings in p͟e͟o͟p͟l͟e awe, wonder, and even delight. Some of the Sun’s optical phenomena are so rare and mysterious that for centuries they were believed to have mystical associations. But knowing the scientific explanations for these natural light shows doesn’t make them any less breathtaking."],
        ["", "Rainbows, among the most common optical effects, are caused by a process known as refraction. Refraction takes place when the Sun’s light rays are bent, reflected, and s͟p͟l͟i͟t into an arc of color as they pass through drops of water in the atmosphere. This happens because light bends at different angles depending on its wavelength."],
        ["", "Other optical effects are rarer because they require more specific circumstances. One such phenomenon is variously called a parhelion, a mock sun, or r͟e͟f͟e͟r͟r͟e͟d͟ ͟t͟o͟ ͟a͟s͟ ͟a͟ ͟s͟u͟n͟d͟o͟g. Sundogs are caused when flat, hexagonal ice crystals are present in the atmosphere. As the crystals move, light is refracted through the crystals to create a circular effect called a halo. If the crystals are being pushed in one direction by the wind, the light will be concentrated in spots on either side of the h͟a͟l͟o these bright spots are known as sundogs."]
