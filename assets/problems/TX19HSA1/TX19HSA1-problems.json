The equation y = (−/4/9)x + 5 has a slope of −4/9; therefore the slope of a line perpendicular to it is 9/4. To determine the y-intercept (value where a line crosses the y-axis) of the perpendicular line, the student could have substituted 9/4 for the slope (m) and the point (36, 0) for the x-and y-values in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). This produces the equation 0 = (9/4)(36) + b. The student could have then multiplied 9/4 by 36, resulting in 0 = 81 + b. The student could have then subtracted 81 from both sides of the equation, resulting in −81 = b. Therefore the slope-intercept form of the equation of the perpendicular line is y = (9/4)x − 81.

Then the student could have found the factors (numbers or expressions that can be multiplied to get another number or expression) of 4x² + 12x − 135. The student could have identified two factors in the form, (Ax + B) and (Cx + D), for which A • C = 4,(A • D) + B C (B •C) = 12, and B • D = −135. The student could have identified the two factors as (2x − 9) and (2x + 15), because 2x • 2x = 4x², (2x • 15) + (−9 • 2x) = 12x, and −9 • 15 = −135. Then the student could have set the factor of 2x− 9 equal to 0 to determine the positive solution to the equation, resulting in 2x − 9 = 0. The student could have then added 9 to both sides of the equation, resulting in 2x = 9. Lastly the student could have divided both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 9/2 = 4.5.

Using the variables t as “the number of courses completed worth 3 credits” and f as “the number of courses completed worth 4 credits,” the equation for the total number of courses completed is t + f = 18, and the equation relating to the total number of credits earned is 3t + 4f = 59. Next the student could have subtracted t from both sides of the first equation to solve for f, resulting in f = 18 − t. Using the substitution method, the student could have substituted f = 18 − t into the second equation, resulting in 3t + 4(18 − t) = 59. The student could have then distributed (multiplied) the 4 to the terms inside the parentheses, resulting in 3t +72 − 4t = 59. The student could have then combined the like terms (terms that contain the same variables raised to the same powers), resulting in 72 − t = 59. The student could have then subtracted 72 from both sides of the equation, resulting in −t = −13. Lastly, the student could have divided both sides of the equation by −1, resulting in t = 13. Therefore the number of courses completed worth 3 credits is 13. The rationale for the correct answer is an efficient way to solve the problem.

The total amount of 64 dollars paid by the first customer is equal to 3 times the price in dollars of each large candle, x, and 4 times the price in dollars of each small candle, y, which can be represented by the equation 3x + 4y = 64.
