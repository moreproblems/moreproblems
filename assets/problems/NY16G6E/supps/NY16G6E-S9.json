        [" ", "their effects on humans. They learned how to dispose of e-waste properly and how it"],
        ["25", "could be recycled. “Then,” he says, “we had to find out what the situation was in our town."],
        [" ", "So we sent out a survey.”"],
        [" ", "\tWhat they found amazed them: Of the people who answered the survey, only one in"],
        [" ", "eight even knew what e-waste was, let alone how to properly dispose of it. One man had"],

        ["30", "was a business he had,” Alex says. “He bought up old computers, took the valuable parts"],

        [" ", "find a responsible company to recycle the waste. That was when Alex and his friends"],
        [" ", "learned another scary fact about e-waste some irresponsible recycling companies don't"],
        ["40", "break down the e-waste and dispose of it safely themselves. Instead, they ship it overseas"],
        [" ", "to countries such as China and Nigeria, where local environmental laws are not enforced"],

        [" ", "\tAfter setting up the e-waste drop-off center, Alex's team began to think about how to"],

        ["50", "seven times more efficient than recycling. If we could refurbish computers ourselves and"],

        [" ", "\tFor a lasting solution to e-waste, the drop-off center wasn't enough. Laws would have"],
