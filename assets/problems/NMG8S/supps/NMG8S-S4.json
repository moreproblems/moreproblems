        [" ", "Edith and Andy enjoy going to an amusement park. Their favorite ride is the roller coaster because of all the changes in speed, direction, and height. They know that every change in speed is also a change in kinetic energy and that every change in height is also a change in gravitational energy."],
        [" ", "They are fascinated that the roller coaster has enough energy at the top of the first hill to reach the end of the ride. They know that an engine applies the force needed to pull the roller coaster car to the top of the first hill. Then, at the end of the ride, a force stops the roller coaster car so that the riders can get off."],
        [" ", "Andy and Edith wonder whether friction is the force that causes the roller coaster car to stop. They decide to use a toy car and pieces of track that have different amounts of friction to investigate how friction affects the car's motion."],
        [" ", "They decide that Edith will hold one end of the track against the wall and put a toy car on the track at point O. When she lets go, the car will move down the track and across the rough part of the track. Andy will measure the time for the car to reach point P at the end of the track. The diagram shows their investigative setup."],
