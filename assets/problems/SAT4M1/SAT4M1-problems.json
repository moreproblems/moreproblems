It follows that angle P is congruent to angle S. In the triangles shown, angle R and angle U are both marked as right angles, so angle R and angle U are corresponding angles. It follows that angle Q and angle T are corresponding angles, and thus, angle Q is congruent to angle T. It's given that the measure of angle Q is 18°, so the measure of angle T is also 18°. Angle U is a right angle, so the measure of angle U is 90°. The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. Thus, the sum of the measures of the interior angles of triangle STU is 180 degrees. Let s represent the measure, in degrees, of angle S. It follows that s + 18 + 90 = 180, or s + 108 = 180. Subtracting 108 from both sides of this equation yields s = 72. Therefore, if the measure of angle Q is 18 degrees, then the measure of angle S is 72 degrees.",

This equation can be rewritten using the distributive property as l + x = 3.5w + 24.5. Since l = 3.5w, the right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten by substituting l for 3.5w, which gives l + x = l + 24.5, or x = 24.5.

Therefore, (x, y) is the only solution to the given system of equations. The given system of equations can be solved by subtracting the second equation, y = 3x + a, from the first equation, y = 2x^2- 21x + 64. This yields y - y = (2x^2- 21x + 64) - (3x + a), or 0 = 2x^2- 24x - a. Since the given system has only one solution, this equation has only one solution. A quadratic equation in the form rx^2+ sx + t = 0, where r, s, and t are constants, has one solution if and only if the discriminant, s² - 4rt, is equal to zero. Substituting 2 for r, -24 for s, and -a + 64 for t in the expression s² - 4rt yields (-24)^2 - (4)(2)(64 - a). Setting this expression equal to zero yields (-24)^2 - (4)(2)(64 - a), or 8a + 64 = 0. Subtracting 64 from both sides of this equation yields 8a = -64. Dividing both sides of this equation by 8 yields a = -8. Substituting -8 for a in the equation 0 = 2x^2- 24x + 64 - a yields 0 = 2x^2- 24x + 64 + 8, or 0 = 2x^2- 24x + 72. Factoring 2 from the right-hand side of this equation yields 0 = 2(x^2- 12x + 36). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields 0 = x^2- 12x + 36, which is equivalent to 0 = (x - 6)(x - 6), or 0 = (x - 6)^2. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields 0 = x - 6. Adding 6 to both sides of this equation yields x = 6.",

Let x be the length, in inches, of each of those sides. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, `a^2+b^2=c^2`, where c is the length of the hypotenuse and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. Substituting x for a, x for b, and 58 for c in this equation yields x^2+ x^2= 58^2, or 2x^2= 58^2. Dividing each side of this equation by 2 yields x^2= 58^2/2, or x^2= (2 • 58^2)/4. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields two solutions: x = (58√2)/2 and x = -(58√2)/2. The value of x must be positive because it represents a side length. Therefore, x = (58√2)/2, or x = 29√2. The perimeter, in inches, of the triangle is 58 + x + x, or 58 + 2x. Substituting 29√2 for x in this expression gives a perimeter, in inches, of 58 + 2(29√2), or 58 + 58√2.",

If a is positive, the parabola will open upward, and if a is negative, the parabola will open downward. It's given that the parabola has vertex (9, -14). Substituting 9 for h and 14- for k in the equation y = a(x - h)^2 + k gives y = a(x - 9)^2 - 14, which can be rewritten as y = a(x - 9)(x - 9) - 14, or y = a(x^2- 18x + 81) - 14. Distributing the factor of a on the right-hand side of this equation yields y = ax^2- 18ax + 81a - 14. Therefore, the equation of the parabola, y = ax^2- 18ax + 81a - 14, can be written in the form y = ax^2+ bx + c, where a = a, b = -18a, and c = 81a - 14. Substituting -18a for b and 81a - 14 for c in the expression a + b + c yields (a) + (-18a) + (81a - 14), or 64a - 14. Since the vertex of the parabola, (9, -14), is below the x-axis, and it's given that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the parabola must open upward. Therefore, the constant a must have a positive value. Setting the expression 64a - 14 equal to the value in this choice yields 64a - 14 = -12. Adding 14 to both sides of this equation yields 64a = 2. Dividing both sides of this equation by 64 yields a = 2/64, which is a positive value. Therefore, if the equation of the parabola is written in the form y = ax^2+ bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, the value of a + b + c could be -12.",
