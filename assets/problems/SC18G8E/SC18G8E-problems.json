He developed an assembly line process for producing his Model T automobile in 1913. By having different workers install specific parts as the vehicle moved slowly along a line, the cost and time needed to build the car was reduced. This made the Model T even more affordable, and, therefore, many more people bought the Ford car.",

When the first McDonald's opened in Southern California in the 1940s, it aimed to be a place for regular people to eat instead of most restaurants of the time that only wealthy people could afford. McDonald's installed a large grill and used spatulas that could flip multiple burgers at a time. Customers could get a large order of burgers and fries quickly because of the restaurant's “Speedee Service System.” When Ray Kroc took over the McDonald's company and spread the eatery across the country, he continued to focus on making good food fast.",

The extra time could be devoted solely to students completing class assignments and teachers assisting those who need help with homework. With an additional hour, students could focus on getting tasks done without the distractions that are common outside of school like television, siblings, and chores. Sometimes teachers run out of time in class to present material in new ways. The added hour could be used to give students the extra support necessary to master the concepts being taught. This change in schedule would solve almost all issues related to incomplete and missing student assignments. Even though people enjoy getting out of school to do fun activities like sports, music, or club meetings, those events can happen an hour later.\n\nSincerely,\nJoseph Grant",
