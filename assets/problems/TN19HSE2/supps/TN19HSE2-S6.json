        [" ", "\tHave you ever looked in an open field during the summer and seen small flashes of light flying through the air? [Fireflies also known as lightning bugs are responsible for this light show.]"],
        [" ", "\tTheir greenish-yellow light results from a chemical reaction in their abdomens. A naturally occurring chemical called luciferin interacts with other chemicals to produce a heatless light. [Called bioluminescence, this feature is found in other animals, such as plankton and lantern fish.]"],
        [" ", "\tAs common as fireflies are, one species found in Tennesseeâ€™s Great Smoky Mountains is exceptional. For two weeks every summer, the synchronous fireflies blink in unison. This synchronous flashing does not occur constantly but in short bursts. Scientists think that the [unusual blink of the fireflies are related] to mating rituals."],
        [" ", "\t[These synchronous fireflies were discovered in the Smoky Mountains in 1995, scientists located other groups in South Carolina and the Appalachian Mountains.] The air temperature and moisture of the soil in these areas is ideal for the fireflies. Experts believe there may be more undiscovered populations of this blinking bug."],
        [" ", "\tThe unusual fireflies have become somewhat of a tourist attraction. During [the fireflys mating season], curious bug-seekers visit the Little River Trailhead at Elkmont, Tennessee. Shuttle buses take tourists to popular viewing sites."]
