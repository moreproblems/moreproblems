For the circle in the xy-plane with equation (x - 5)^2 + (y - 3)^2, it follows that r² = 16. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields r = 4 or r = -4. Because r represents the length of the radius of the circle and this length must be positive, r = 4. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 4. The diameter of a circle is twice the length of the radius of the circle. Thus, 2(4) yields 8. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 8.",

Since the model estimates that at the end of each year, the number was 150% more than the number at the end of the previous year, p = 150. Substituting 150 for p in the equation n = a(1 + p/100)ᵗyields n = a(1 + 150/100)ᵗ, which is equivalent to n = a(1 + 1.5)ᵗ, or n = a(2.5)ᵗ. It's given that the estimated number of squirrels at the end of 2016 was 180. This means that when t = 1, n = 180. Substituting 1 for t and 180 for n in the equation n = a(2.5)ᵗ yields 180 = a(2.5)¹, or 180 = 2.5a. Dividing each side of this equation by 2.5 yields 72 = a.

                    "Rationale": "Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to -1 divided by the slope of the second line. Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, `y=mx+b`, where m is the slope of the graph of the equation in the xy-plane and `(0,b)` is the y-intercept. For the first equation, 5x + 7y = 1, subtracting 5x from both sides gives 7y = -5x + 1, and dividing both sides of this equation by 7 gives y = -(5/7)x + 2/7. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is -5/7. For the second equation, ax + by = 1, subtracting ax from both sides gives by = -ax + 1, and dividing both sides of this equation by b gives y = -(a/b)x + 1/b. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is -a/b. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, -a/b, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, -5/7. The negative reciprocal of -5/7 is -1/(-5/7), or 7/5. Therefore, -a/b = 7/5, or a/b = -7/5. Similarly, rewriting the equations in this choice in slope-intercept form yields y = -(10/7)x + 1/7 and y = -(a/2b)x + 1/2b. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in this choice is -10/7 and the slope of the graph of the second equation in this choice is -a/2b. Since a/b = -7/5, -a/2b is equal to -(1/2)(-7/5), or 7/10. Since 7/10 is the negative reciprocal of -10/7, the pair of equations in this choice represents a pair of perpendicular lines.",
