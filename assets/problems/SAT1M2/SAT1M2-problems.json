Because r represents the length of the radius of the circle and this length must be positive, r = 4. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 4.

                    "Rationale": "Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to –1 divided by the slope of the second line. Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the graph of the equation in the xy-plane and (0, b) is the y-intercept. For the first equation, 5x + 7y = 1, subtracting 5x from both sides gives 7y = –5x + 1, and dividing both sides of this equation by 7 gives y = –(5/7)x + 2/7. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is –5/7. For the second equation, ax + by = 1, subtracting ax from both sides gives by = –ax + 1, and dividing both sides of this equation by b gives y = –(a/b)x + 1/b. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is –a/b. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, –a/b, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, –5/7. The negative reciprocal of –5/7 is –1/(–5/7), or 7/5. Therefore, –a/b = 7/5, or a/b = –7/5. Similarly, rewriting the equations in choice B in slope-intercept form yields y = –(10/7)x + 1/7 and y = –(a/2b)x + 1/2b. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in choice B is –10/7 and the slope of the graph of the second equation in choice B is –a/2b. Since a/b = -7/5, –a/2b is equal to –(1/2)(–7/5), or 7/10. Since 7/10 is the negative reciprocal of –10/7, the pair of equations in choice B represents a pair of perpendicular lines.",

It follows that the given equation has no real solutions when 1,156 – 4c < 0. Adding 4c to both sides of this inequality yields 1,156 < 4c. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 4 yields 289 < c, or c > 289. It's given that the equation x² – 34 + c = 0 has no real solutions when c > n. Therefore, the least possible value of n is 289.",
