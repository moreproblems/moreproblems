        ["4", "\t“You should really try flying a paper plate” said Stella's friend Robby. Stella looked at Robby's kite. He had decorated a plate with stickers and a long yellow streamer and attached a string to it. Right now, his paper plate was flying so high that Stella could hardly see it."],
        ["5", "\t“Your shark kite hasn't flown as high as my paper plate all day,” said Robby, wiping his nose on his sleeve."],
        ["6", "\t“Paper plates are for babies,” said Stella. She felt like being mean, because her shark kite could hardly fly."],
        ["7", "\tJust then Stella noticed a fluffy pink jellyfish kite sailing overhead, bobbing a little as it passed Robby's paper plate. Stella wished she could trade her shark for that jellyfish."],
        ["8", "\tStella wound the string of her fallen kite around its spool. Then, holding the string near the shark's belly, she started running. If she could catch a tiny breeze, her kite would fly."],
        ["9", "\t“Stella, it's almost time to go!” called Stella's mother from a park bench in the shade. “We have to pick up your sister at the pool.”"],
        ["10", "\t“Come on, shark, fly!” Stella said as she tossed the kite into a little puff of wind. For a moment, the shark looked as if it was swimming up into the sky. Then, it dove back toward the grass, teeth and all."],
        ["11", "\t“Maybe it's too heavy,” said Robby. He tugged lightly on the string of his paper plate, which dipped gently in the air."],
