(2) It may be surprising to find out that the word calico refers to the color pattern, not to the breed, size, or personality of the cat. (3) Almost any breed of cat — including the American shorthair the American wirehair, and the Japanese bobtail — can have the calico color pattern. (4) It is interesting that calico cats are considered a sign of good luck, are viewed as peaceful, and are nearly always female.",
