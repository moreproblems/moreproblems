It's also given that Davio bought twice as many pounds of celery as pounds of potatoes; therefore, `c=2p`. Substituting `2p` for `c` in the equation `0.69p+0.99c=5.34` yields `0.69p+0.99(2p)=5.34`, which is equivalent to `0.69+1.98p=5.34`, or `2.67p=5.34`. Dividing both sides of this equation by `2.67` yields `p=2`. Substituting `2` for `p` in the equation `c=2p` yields `c=2(2)`, or `c=4`. Therefore, Davio bought `4text( pounds)` of celery.",
