Using the distributive property of multiplication, this expression is equivalent to 3x(x + 2b) + 7(x + 2b), or 3x² + 6xb + 7x + 14b. Combining the x-terms in this expression yields 3x² + (7 + 6b)x + 14b. It follows that the coefficient of the x-term is equal to 7 + 6b. Thus, from the given choices, 7 + 6b must be equal to 7, 28, 42, or 49. Therefore, b 6 must be equal to 0, 21, 35, or 42, respectively, and b must be equal to 0/6, 21/6, 35/6, or 42/6, respectively. Of these four values of b, only 42/6, or 7, is a positive integer. It follows that 7 + 6b must be equal to 49 because this is the only choice for which the value of b is a positive integer constant.

Thus, the mean of data set A is greater than the mean of data set B. Therefore, the smallest possible difference between the mean of data set A and the mean of data set B is the difference between the smallest possible mean of data set A and the greatest possible mean of data set B.

The height of the triangle, k√3, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the 60° angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of k√3, it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each 30° angle has a length of k and each hypotenuse has a length of 2k. In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is 2k. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 624; therefore, 2k + 2k + 2k = 624, or 6k = 624. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields k = 104.",
