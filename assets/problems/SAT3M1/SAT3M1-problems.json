This means the candle loses 11 ounces of wax during that period of time. It's given that the amount of wax decreases by 1 ounce every 4 hours.

                    "Rationale": "Let x be the first integer and let y be the second integer. If the first integer is 11 greater than twice the second integer, then x = 2y + 11. If the product of the two integers is 546, then xy = 546. Substituting 2y + 11 for x in this equation results in (2y + 11)y = 546. Distributing the y to both terms in the parentheses results in 2y² + 11y = 546. Subtracting 546 from both sides of this equation results in 2y² + 11y - 546 = 0. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is 2(-546), or -1,092, and whose sum is 11. The two values whose product is -1,092 and whose sum is 11 are 39 and -28. Thus, the equation 2y² + 11y - 546 = 0 can be rewritten as  2y² + 28y -39y - 546 = 0, which is equivalent to 2x(y - 14) + 39(y - 14) = 0, or (2y + 39)(y - 14) = 0. By the zero product property, it follows that 2y + 39 = 0 and y - 14 = 0. Subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation 2y + 39 = 0 yields 2y = -39. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields y = -39/2. Since y is a positive integer, the value of y is not -39/2. Adding 14 to both sides of the equation y - 14 = 0 yields y = 14. Substituting 14 for y in the equation xy = 546 yields x(14) = 546. Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 results in x = 39. Therefore, the two integers are 14 and 39, so the smaller of the two integers is 14.",

Substituting -7 for x and -2 for y in the equation y = a/(x + b) yields -2 = a/(-7 + b). Multiplying each side of this equation by -7 + b yields -2(-7 + b) = a, or 14 - 2b = a.

The equation of a circle in the xy-plane can be written in the form (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where the coordinates of the center of the circle are (h, k) and the length of the radius of the circle is r. The term (x-h)² in this equation can be obtained by adding the square of half the coefficient of x to both sides of the given equation to complete the square. The coefficient of x is 1. Half the coefficient of x is 1/2. The square of half the coefficient of x is 1/4. Adding 1/4 to each side of (x² + x) + (y² + y) = 199/2 yields (x² + x + 1/4) + (y² + y) = 199/2 + 1/4, or (x + 1/2)² + (y² + y) = 199/2 + 1/4. Similarly, the term (y - k)² can be obtained by adding the square of half the coefficient of y to both sides of this equation, which yields (x + 1/2)² + (y² + y + 1/4) = 199/2 + 1/4 + 1/4, or (x + 1/2)² + (y + 1/2)² = 199/2 + 1/4 + 1/4. This equation is equivalent to (x + 1/2)² + (y + 1/2)² = 100, or (x + 1/2)² + (y + 1/2)² = 10². Therefore, the length of the circle's radius is 10.",
