The amount of wax the candle has lost during the time period can be found by subtracting the remaining amount of wax from the amount of wax the candle was made of, which yields 17 - 6 ounces, or 11 ounces. This means the candle loses 11 ounces of wax during that period of time. It's given that the amount of wax decreases by 1 ounce every 4 hours. If h represents the number of hours the candle has been burning, it follows that 1/4 = 11/h. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 4h yields h = 44.

                    "Rationale": "Let x be the first integer and let y be the second integer. If the first integer is 11 greater than twice the second integer, then x = 2y + 11. If the product of the two integers is 546, then xy = 546. Substituting 2y + 11 for x in this equation results in (2y + 11)y = 546. Distributing the y to both terms in the parentheses results in 2y^2+ 11y = 546. Subtracting 546 from both sides of this equation results in 2y^2+ 11y - 546 = 0. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is 2(-546), or -1,092, and whose sum is 11. The two values whose product is -1,092 and whose sum is 11 are 39 and -28. Thus, the equation 2y^2+ 11y - 546 = 0 can be rewritten as  2y^2+ 28y -39y - 546 = 0, which is equivalent to 2x(y - 14) + 39(y - 14) = 0, or (2y + 39)(y - 14) = 0. By the zero product property, it follows that 2y + 39 = 0 and y - 14 = 0. Subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation 2y + 39 = 0 yields 2y = -39. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields y = -39/2. Since y is a positive integer, the value of y is not -39/2. Adding 14 to both sides of the equation y - 14 = 0 yields y = 14. Substituting 14 for y in the equation xy = 546 yields x(14) = 546. Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 results in x = 39. Therefore, the two integers are 14 and 39, so the smaller of the two integers is 14.",

Substituting y for f(x) in the equation f(x) = a/(x + b) yields y = a/(x + b). The graph passes through the point (-7, -2). Substituting -7 for x and -2 for y in the equation y = a/(x + b) yields -2 = a/(-7 + b). Multiplying each side of this equation by -7 + b yields -2(-7 + b) = a, or 14 - 2b = a. The graph also passes through the point (-5, -6). Substituting -5 for x and -6 for y in the equation y = a/(x + b) yields -6 = a/(-5 + b). Multiplying each side of this equation by -5 + b yields -6(-5 + b) = a, or 30 - 6b = a. Substituting 14 - 2b for a in this equation yields 30 - 6b = 14 - 2b.

Substituting 4 for b in the equation 14 - 2b = a yields 14 - 2(4) = a, or 6 = a. Substituting 6 for a and 4 for b in the equation f(x) = a/(x + b) yields f(x) = 6/(x + 4). It's given that g(x) = f(x + 4). Substituting x + 4 for x in the equation f(x) = 6/(x + 4) yields f(x + 4) = 6/(x + 4 + 4), which is equivalent to f(x + 4) = 6/(x + 8).

The equation of a circle in the xy-plane can be written in the form `(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2`, where the coordinates of the center of the circle are `(h,k)` and the length of the radius of the circle is r. The term (x-h)^2 in this equation can be obtained by adding the square of half the coefficient of x to both sides of the given equation to complete the square. The coefficient of x is 1. Half the coefficient of x is 1/2. The square of half the coefficient of x is 1/4. Adding 1/4 to each side of (x^2+ x) + (y^2+ y) = 199/2 yields (x^2+ x + 1/4) + (y^2+ y) = 199/2 + 1/4, or (x + 1/2)^2 + (y^2+ y) = 199/2 + 1/4. Similarly, the term (y - k)^2 can be obtained by adding the square of half the coefficient of y to both sides of this equation, which yields (x + 1/2)^2 + (y^2+ y + 1/4) = 199/2 + 1/4 + 1/4, or (x + 1/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 = 199/2 + 1/4 + 1/4. This equation is equivalent to (x + 1/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 = 100, or (x + 1/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 = 10^2. Therefore, the length of the circle's radius is 10.",
