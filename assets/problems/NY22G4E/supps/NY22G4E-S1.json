If a little one swims too far away, it's his dad's job to put him back into place. He gently grasps the wandering fish in his mouth and—aaapooey! He spits the young wanderer back with his brothers and sisters."],

This South American dad picks up the young ones with his tongue and slides them through slits in his vocal sacs. As the babies grow, they push on Dad's throat and prevent him from croaking. Finally, when the babies are big enough, they crawl out of Dad's throat and hop away. (In case you were wondering, there are times when Dad accidentally swallows one. Oops!)"],

When she's done, the father swims away and does all the caregiving. He visits the water's surface so the eggs can get air and uses his hind feet to clean the eggs. Once the babies are on their own, the father rubs off the sticky egg pad."],

The pair works carefully to roll the egg to the top of his feet. He covers it with a flap of thick belly skin. The mother penguin then leaves for 2 months. She travels to open hunting waters that are over 50 miles away. In the meantime, the father keeps the egg on his feet. He doesn't eat. He doesn't drink. He just huddles together with the other fathers to keep their eggs warm. When the egg hatches, the chick stays cozy in the same place—on Dad's feet, under a layer of skin. Soon after, the mother returns and takes over while Dad goes hunting."],

The father brings the mother food every 4 to 6 hours until the kits are old enough to roam outside. To teach them how to find their own food, the father red fox buries extra meat near the den and hides it with twigs."],
