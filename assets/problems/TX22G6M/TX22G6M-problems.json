                    "Correct": false,
                    "Rationale": "The student likely concluded that since 7 is the median of the values in the “stem” column and 5 is the median of the digits 0 through 10, half of the tire pressures would be below 75 pounds per square inch. The student needs to focus on understanding how to interpret information displayed in a stem and leaf plot.",

                    "Correct": false,
                    "Rationale": "The student likely disregarded the repeated values in the interval from 80 to 89 pounds per square inch. The student needs to focus on understanding how to interpret information displayed in a stem and leaf plot.",

                    "Correct": true,
                    "Rationale": "To determine which statement is best supported by the stem and leaf plot, the student could have noticed that three tires have pressures ranging from 50 to 59 pounds per square inch and only one tire has a pressure of 65 pounds per square inch, resulting in three times as many tires that have pressures from 50 to 59 pounds per square inch as tires that have a pressure of 65 pounds per square inch, since 1 × 3 = 3.",

                    "Correct": false,
                    "Rationale": "The student likely misunderstood that the leaf of “0” next to the stem of “50” represents the value of 50 pounds per square inch and disregarded this value. The student needs to focus on understanding how to interpret information displayed in a stem and leaf plot.",
