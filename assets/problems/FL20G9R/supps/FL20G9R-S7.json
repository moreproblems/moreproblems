In fact, plaid had several important functions when it was first created in the 1500s. Back then, plaid reigned supreme in Scotland and was actually tartan. Plaid and tartan are very similar, but not the exact same thing; tartan is a wool fabric with intersecting lines. These lines form a plaid pattern. An easy way to remember the difference is this rule of t͟h͟u͟m͟b͟; “all tartans are plaid, but not all plaid is tartan.”"],

In the early nineteenth century, the pattern expanded to the United States and became formally known as plaid. American and British manufacturers started mass-producing it in fabrics that were laden with less meaning and weight than tartan was. The rest, as they say, is history."]
