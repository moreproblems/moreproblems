This means the bowl loses 11 ounces of water during that period of time. It’s given that the amount of water decreases by 1 ounce every 4 days.

Since the distribution of the values of both data set A and data set B form symmetric dot plots, and each data set has an odd number of values, it follows that the median is given by the middle value in each of the dot plots. Thus, the median of data set A is 13, and the median of data set B is 13. Therefore, statement I is true. Data set A and data set B have the same frequency for each of the values 11, 12, 14, and 15. Data set A has a frequency of 1 for values 10 and 16, whereas data set B has a frequency of 2 for values 10 and 16. Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a data set; it is larger when there are more values farther from the mean, and smaller when there are more values closer to the mean. Since both distributions are symmetric with an odd number of values, the mean of each data set is equal to its median. Thus, each data set has a mean of 13. Since more of the values in data set A are closer to 13 than in data set B, it follows that data set A has a smaller standard deviation than data set B. Thus, statement II is false.

Let x° represent the measure of ∠RSO. It follows that the measure of ∠ORS is also x°. It’s given that the measure of ∠ROS is 88°. Because the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, the equation x° + x° + 88° = 180°, or 2x + 88 = 180, can be used to find the measure of ∠RSO.

                    "Rationale": "A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, Ax + By = C and Dx + Ey = F, are parallel if the coefficients for x and y in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning D/A = E/B; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning F/C is not equal to D/A or E/B. The given equation, y = 6x + 18, can be written in standard form by subtracting 6x from both sides of the equation to yield –6x + y = 18. Therefore, the given equation can be written in the form Ax + By = C, where A = -,6 B = 1, and C = 18. The equation in this choice, –6x + y = 22, is written in the form Dx + Ey = F, where D = -6, E = 1, and F = 22. Therefore, D/A = (-6)/(-6), which can be rewritten as D/A = 1; E/B = 1/1, which can be rewritten as E/B = 1; and F/C = 22/18, which can be rewritten as F/C = 11/9. Since D/A = 1, E/B = 1, and F/C is not equal to 1, it follows that the given equation and the equation –6x + y = 22 are parallel and distinct. Therefore, a system of two linear equations consisting of the given equation and the equation –6x + y = 22 has no solution. Thus, the equation in this choice could be the second equation in the system.",

Squaring both sides of this equation yields  ((x² - c²)/√(x² – c²))² = 39², or (x² - c²)(x² - c²)/(x² – c²) = 39². Since x² – c² is positive and, therefore, nonzero, the expression (x² - c²)/(x² – c²) is defined and equivalent to 1. It follows that the equation (x² - c²)(x² - c²)/(x² – c²) = 39² can be rewritten as ((x² - c²)/(x² – c²))(x² - c²) = 39², or (1)(x² - c²) = 39², which is equivalent to x² - c² = 39².

It’s given that function g estimates that the seal reached its maximum depth of 302.4 meters 6 minutes after it entered the water. Therefore, function g can be expressed in vertex form as g(t) = a(t - 6)² + 302.4, where a is a constant. Since it’s also given that the seal reached the surface of the water after 12 minutes, g(12) = 0. Substituting 12 for t and 0 for g(t) in g(t) = a(t - 6)² + 302.4 yields 0 = a(12 - 6)² + 302.4, or 36a = -302.4. Dividing both sides of this equation by 36 gives a = -8.4. Substituting -8.4 for a in g(t) = a(t - 6)² + 302.4 gives g(t) = -8.4(t - 6)² + 302.4. Substituting 10 for t in g(t) gives g(10) = -8.4(10 - 6)² + 302.4, which is equivalent to g(10) = -8.4(4)² + 302.4, or g(10) = 168.
