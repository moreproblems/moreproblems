To do this, the students wrapped a piece of insulated copper wire around an iron nail and then connected the two ends of the wire to a battery, making the nail magnetic. The number of wraps of the wire around the nail affected the number of metal paperclips that the electromagnet could pick up at one time. The results of the studentsâ€™ experiment are shown in the data table below."],
