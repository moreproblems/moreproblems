        [" ", "In forested regions of Pennsylvania where maple trees are plentiful, making maple syrup is a time-honored tradition. When air temperatures are below freezing at night but above freezing during the day, the sap in maple trees begins to flow. This means that water, sugar, and minerals from the soil move upward through the xylem inside the trees. Xylem is a tissue in plants through which water and minerals move. Xylem also provides some structural support. Maple syrup makers access the sap by making a hole through the tree bark and into the outer area of xylem, commonly known as sapwood. They insert a spout, also called a spile, into this hole. This is called tapping the tree."],

        [" ", "Traditionally, maple tree sap was collected from buckets attached to the spiles. Maple syrup makers would visit each tree, sometimes several times a day, to empty the sap from each bucket into a larger collection container. Today, some maple syrup makers use a tubing system that allows sap to move from each tapped tree to a collection tank located where the sap processing occurs."],
        [" ", "Processing the sap into maple syrup typically involves reducing water content by heating the sap in large pans. Once the liquid reaches a precise finishing temperature and density, it is maple syrup. It takes nearly 40 gallons of sap from maple trees to make 1 gallon of maple syrup."]
