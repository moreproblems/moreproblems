        ["1", "Once there was a grand old tree."],
        ["2", "Her roots sank deep into the earth, her arms reached high into the sky."],
        ["3", "She was home to many creatures. Birds nested among her branches, squirrels scurried through her leaves, caterpillars and ladybugs crawled about."],
        ["4", "The grand old tree flowered, bore fruit, and sowed seeds."],
        ["5", "She had many children. They changed the landscape for miles around, perhaps even farther than the old tree knew."],
        ["6", "The grand old tree lived a long, long time. She basked in the sun, bathed in the rain, swayed in the breeze, and danced in the wind."],
        ["", "problems/RI22G3E/media/S1a.jpg"],
        ["7", "She grew and shed ..."],
        ["8", "... many millions of leaves."],
        ["9", "At last, the grand old tree was very, very old. Her branches no longer swayed and danced, but cracked and snapped in the wind."],
        ["10", "Finally she fell, and snow gently covered her."],
        ["11", "The old tree died. She no longer flowered, bore fruit, or sowed seeds, but she was still home to many creatures."],
        ["12", "Raccoons nested in her trunk, centipedes crawled along her branches, and lichen grew on her bark."],
        ["13", "The grand old tree slowly crumbled."],
        ["14", "She became part of the earth."],
        ["15", "Today the roots of her grandchildren sink deep into this earth. Their arms reach high into the sky."],
        ["16", "They are home to many creatures, just like the grand old tree."]
