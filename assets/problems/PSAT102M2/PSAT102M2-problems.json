                    "Rationale": "According to the graph, the king crab supply in 2011 was 80 million pounds. So at the price of $17 per pound, the revenue generated, in millions of dollars, from the sales of king crab in 2011 was (80)(17) = 1360. Since x millions pounds of king crab was sold in 2012 at the price of $16 per pound, th  revenue in 2012 was 16x million dollars. It is given that the revenue generated from the sales of king crab in 2011 was the same as the revenue in 2012. Therefore, 16x = 1360, so x = 85.",
