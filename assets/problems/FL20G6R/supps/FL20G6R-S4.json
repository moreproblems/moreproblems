        [" ", "When people see a bird land on a branch or telephone wire, they may not think about where that bird is going. Birds are some of the most well- traveled species on Earth. Some m͟i͟g͟r͟a͟t͟o͟r͟y birds, like the painted bunting, travel as little as a few hundred miles per year. Others, like the Arctic tern, travel up to 22,000 miles annually."],
        [" ", "Birds do not make these long and tiring journeys just to avoid cold weather. They travel for food, which can be hard to find in winter. Some birds even fly to another hemisphere to make sure they'll have enough to eat. Most do not return north until the spring or summer, when i͟t͟ ͟i͟s much more abundant. That is when there are new caterpillars, insects, and tree blossoms to eat."],
        [" ", "Birds may fly different distances and at a variety of speeds. The red knot spends spring and summer in northern C͟a͟n͟a͟d͟a͟ ͟w͟h͟e͟r͟e͟ ͟i͟t͟s͟ ͟b͟r͟e͟e͟d͟i͟n͟g͟ ͟g͟r͟o͟u͟n͟d͟s͟ ͟a͟r͟e͟ ͟l͟o͟c͟a͟t͟e͟d and winters as far south as the southern tip of South America. It is a shore bird and can fly up to 60 miles an hour. The w͟o͟o͟d͟ ͟t͟h͟r͟u͟s͟h͟ ͟a͟ ͟t͟y͟p͟e͟ ͟o͟f͟ ͟s͟o͟n͟g͟b͟i͟r͟d͟, travels from Central America to the Mid-Atlantic States, such as Maryland and Virginia. Songbirds fly at a speed of about 10-30 miles per hour."]
