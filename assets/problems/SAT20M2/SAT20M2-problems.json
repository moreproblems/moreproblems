Lynne has $8.00 to spend; therefore, the inequality for the number of apples and oranges Lynne can buy is 0.65x + 0.75y ≤ 8.00. Since Lynne bought 5 apples, x = 5. Substituting 5 for x yields 0.65(5) + 0.75y ≤ 8.00, which can be rewritten as 3.25 + 0.75y ≤ 8.00. Subtracting 3.25 from both sides of the inequality yields 0.75y ≤ 4.75.

                    "Rationale": "If a line intersects a parabola at a point, the coordinates of the intersection point must satisfy the equation of the line and the equation of the parabola. Since the equation of the line is y = c, where c is a constant, the `y`-coordinate of the intersection point must be c. It follows then that substituting c for y in the equation for the parabola will result in another true equation: c = -x^2+ 5x. Subtracting c from both sides of c = -x^2+ 5x and then dividing both sides by -1 yields 0 = x^2- 5x + c. The solution to this quadratic equation would give the `x`-coordinate(s) of the point(s) of intersection. Since it's given that the line and parabola intersect at exactly one point, the equation 0 = x^2- 5x + c has exactly one solution. A quadratic equation in the form `0=ax^2+bx+c` has exactly one solution when its discriminant `b^2-4ac` is equal to 0. In the equation 0 = x^2- 5x + c, a = 1, b = -5, and c = c. Therefore, (-5)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 0, or 25 - 4c = 0. Subtracting 25 from both sides of 25 - 4c = 0 and then dividing both sides by -4 yields c = 25/4. Therefore, if the line y = c intersects the parabola defined by y = -x 2 + 5x at exactly one point, then c = 25/4.",
