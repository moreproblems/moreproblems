                    "Rationale": "The student likely used 45 as a rate of change and multiplied each number of eggs by 45 (6 × 45 = 270, 9 × 45 = 405, 12 × 45 = 540, and 15 × 45 = 675), resulting in 6 eggs can be used to make 270 cookies, 9 eggs can be used to make 405 cookies, 12 eggs can be used to make 540 cookies, and 15 eggs can be used to make 675 cookies.

                    "Rationale": "To determine the table that shows the relationship between the number of eggs used and the number of cookies made, the student could have determined that since 3 eggs are used to make 45 cookies, then multiplying each of these numbers by a scale factor (common multiple for each value of a proportion) of 2 (3 × 2 = 6 and 45 × 2 = 90) will result in 6 eggs can be used to make 90 cookies. The student then could have used other scale factors to determine the other values in the table: a scale factor of 3 will result in 9 eggs can be used to make 135 cookies, a scale factor of 4 will result in 12 eggs can be used to make 180 cookies, and a scale factor of 5 will result in 15 eggs can be used to make 225 cookies. This is an efficient way to solve the problem; however, other methods could be used to solve the problem correctly.",
