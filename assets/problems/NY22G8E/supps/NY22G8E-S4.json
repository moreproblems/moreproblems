        ["1", "\t“Dad, tell me a story from when you were little. Tell me the story about the time you met your best friend Chris at school.” Six-year-old Alex, who has just started school himself, snuggles into his pillow and catches his dad's hand in the dark. They have finished the nightly reading of Tin Tin and now it's time for “just one more story” before Alex goes to sleep."],
        ["2", "\tMost parents know about the benefits of reading stories from books with their young children. Parents are blasted with this message in pediatricians' offices, at preschool, on TV, even with billboards on the city bus. Reading books with children on a daily basis advances their language skills, extends their learning about the world, and helps their own reading later in school. Reading with your child from a young age can instill a lifelong love of books. A new study published in Science even shows that reading literary fiction improves adults' ability to understand other people's emotions."],
        ["3", "\tReading books with your children is clearly a good idea..."],
        ["4", "\tYet what most parents don't know is that everyday family stories, like the one that Alex's dad spun out that night, confer many of the same benefits of reading—and even some new ones."],
        ["5", "\tOver the last 25 years, a small canon¹ of research on family storytelling shows that when parents share more family stories with their children—especially when they tell those stories in a detailed and responsive way—their children benefit in a host of ways. For instance, experimental studies show that when parents learn to reminisce² about everyday events with their preschool children in more detailed ways, their children tell richer, more complete narratives to other adults one to two years later compared to children whose parents didn't learn the new reminiscing techniques. Children of the parents who learned new ways to reminisce also demonstrate better understanding of other people's thoughts and emotions. These advanced narrative and emotional skills serve children well in the school years when reading complex material and learning to get along with others. In the preteen years, children whose families collaboratively discuss everyday events and family history more often have higher self-esteem and stronger self-concepts. And adolescents with a stronger knowledge of family history have more robust identities, better coping skills, and lower rates of depression and anxiety. Family storytelling can help a child grow into a teen who feels connected to the important people in her life."],
        ["6", "\tBest of all, unlike stories from books, family stories are always free and completely portable. You don't even need to have the lights on to share with your child a story about your day, about their day, about your childhood or their grandma's. In the research on family storytelling, all of these kinds of stories are linked to benefits for your child. Family stories can continue to be part of a parent's daily interactions with their children into adolescence, long past the age of the bedtime story."],
        ["7", "\tAll families have stories to tell, regardless of their culture or their circumstances. Of course, not all of these stories are idyllic³ ones. Research shows that children and adolescents can learn a great deal from stories of life's more difficult moments—as long as those stories are told in a way that is sensitive to the child's level of understanding, and as long as something good is gleaned from the experience..."],
        ["8", "\tBooks contain narratives, but only family stories contain your family's personal narratives. Fortunate children get both. They hear and read stories from books to become part of other people's worlds, and they hear and tell stories of their family to understand who they are and from whence they came..."],
        ["9", "\tThe holidays are prime time for family storytelling. When you're... having your holiday meal, share a story with your children about past holidays. Leave in the funny bits, the sad bits, the gory and smelly bits—kids can tell when a story has been sanitized for their protection. Then invite everyone else to tell a story too. Don't forget the youngest and the oldest storytellers in the group. Their stories may not be as coherent,⁴ but they can be the truest, and the most revealing."],
        ["10", "\tFamily stories can be told nearly anywhere. They cost us only our time, our memories, our creativity. They can inspire us, protect us, and bind us to others. So be generous with your stories, and be generous in your stories. Remember that your children may have them for a lifetime."]
