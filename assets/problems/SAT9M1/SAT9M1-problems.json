It's given that the initial balance of the account is $36,100.00, so it follows that the initial value of the function, or N, must be 36,100.00. Substituting 36,100.00 for N in the equation A(t) = Nrᵗ yields A(t) = 36,100.00rᵗ. It's given that the account balance after 13 years, or when t = 13, is $68,071.93. It follows that A(13) = 68,071.93, or 36,100.00r¹³ = 68,071.93. Dividing each side of the equation 36,100.00r¹³ = 68,071.93 by 36,100.00 yields r¹³ = 68,071.93/36,100.00. Taking the 13th root of both sides of this equation yields r = ¹³√(68,071.93/36,100.00), or r is approximately equal to 1.05. Substituting 1.05 for r in the equation A(t) = 36,100.00rᵗ yields A(t) = 36,100.00(1.05)ᵗ, so the equation A(t) = 36,100.00(1.05)ᵗ could define A.",

Since ∠SOP and ∠ROQ are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc PS and arc QR are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, ∠SOR and ∠POQ are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc SR and arc PQ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let x represent the length of arc SR. Since arc SR and arc PQ are congruent arcs, the length of arc PQ can also be represented by x. It's given that the length of arc PS is twice the length of arc PQ. Therefore, the length of arc PS can be represented by the expression 2x. Since arc PS and arc QR are congruent arcs, the length of arc QR can also be represented by 2x. This gives the expression x + x + 2x + 2x. Since it's given that the circumference is 144π, the expression x + x + 2x + 2x is equal to 144π. Thus x + x + 2x + 2x = 144π, or 6x = 144π. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields x = 24π. Therefore, the length of arc QR is 2(24π), or 48π.",

Let b represent the length of the other leg of the triangle, in millimeters. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, 43.2² + b² = 196.8², or 1,866.24 + b² = 38,730.24. Subtracting 1,866.24 from both sides of this equation yields b² = 36,864. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields b = 192.

Combining like terms yields f(x - 1) = (x + 5)(x + 4)(x). Therefore, g(x) = x(x + 5)(x + 4). The x-intercepts of a graph in the xy-plane are the points where y = 0. The x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of y = g(x) in the xy-plane can be found by solving the equation 0 = x(x + 5)(x + 4). Applying the zero product property to this equation yields three equations: x = 0, x + 5 = 0, and x + 4 = 0. Solving each of these equations for x yields x = 0, x = -5, and x = -4, respectively. Therefore, the x-intercepts of the graph of y = g(x) are (0, 0), (-5, 0), and (-4, 0). It follows that the values of a, b, and c are 0, -5, and -4.

Expanding the quantity (x + 5)² in this equation yields f(x + 5) = 4(x² + 10x + 25) + 64(x + 5) + 262. Distributing the 4 and the 64 yields f(x + 5) = 4x² + 40x + 100 + 64x + 320 + 262. Combining like terms yields f(x + 5) = 4x² + 104x + 682. Therefore, g(x) = 4x² + 104x + 682.
