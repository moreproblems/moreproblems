It’s given that the initial balance of the account is $36,100.00, so it follows that the initial value of the function, or N, must be 36,100.00. Substituting 36,100.00 for N in the equation A(t) = Nrᵗ yields A(t) = 36,100.00rᵗ. It’s given that the account balance after 13 years, or when t = 13, is $68,071.93. It follows that A(13) = 68,071.93, or 36,100.00r¹³ = 68,071.93. Dividing each side of the equation 36,100.00r¹³ = 68,071.93 by 36,100.00 yields r¹³ = 68,071.93/36,100.00. Taking the 13th root of both sides of this equation yields r = ¹³√(68,071.93/36,100.00), or r is approximately equal to 1.05. Substituting 1.05 for r in the equation A(t) = 36,100.00rᵗ yields A(t) = 36,100.00(1.05)ᵗ, so the equation A(t) = 36,100.00(1.05)ᵗ could define A.",

Since ∠SOP and ∠ROQ are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc PS and arc QR are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, ∠SOR and ∠POQ are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc SR and arc PQ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let x represent the length of arc SR. Since arc SR and arc PQ are congruent arcs, the length of arc PQ can also be represented by x. It’s given that the length of arc PS is twice the length of arc PQ. Therefore, the length of arc PS can be represented by the expression 2x. Since arc PS and arc QR are congruent arcs, the length of arc QR can also be represented by 2x. This gives the expression x + x + 2x + 2x. Since it’s given that the circumference is 144π, the expression x + x + 2x + 2x is equal to 144π. Thus x + x + 2x + 2x = 144π, or 6x = 144π. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields x = 24π.

Applying the zero product property to this equation yields three equations: x = 0, x + 5 = 0, and x + 4 = 0. Solving each of these equations for x yields x = 0, x = -5, and x = -4, respectively.

Expanding the quantity (x + 5)² in this equation yields f(x + 5) = 4(x² + 10x + 25) + 64(x + 5) + 262. Distributing the 4 and the 64 yields f(x + 5) = 4x² + 40x + 100 + 64x + 320 + 262. Combining like terms yields f(x + 5) = 4x² + 104x + 682. Therefore, g(x) = 4x² + 104x + 682. For a quadratic function defined by an equation of the form g(x) = a(x - h)² + k where a, h, and k are constants and a is positive, g(x) reaches its minimum, k, when the value of x is h. The equation g(x) = 4x² + 104x + 682 can be rewritten in this form by completing the square. This equation is equivalent to g(x) = 4(x² + 26x) + 682, or g(x) = 4(x² + 26x + 169 - 169) + 682. This equation can be rewritten as g(x) = 4((x + 13)² - 169) + 682, or g(x) = 4(x + 13)² - 4(169) + 682, which is equivalent to g(x) = 4(x + 13)² + 6.
