    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Grade 4",
    "Overview": "In Grade 4, instructional time should focus on three areas: (1) developing understanding and fluency with multi-digit multiplication, and developing understanding of dividing to find quotients involving multi-digit dividends; (2) developing an understanding of fraction equivalence, addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators, and multiplication of fractions by whole numbers; and (3) understanding that geometric figures can be analyzed and classified based on their properties, such as having parallel sides, perpendicular sides, particular angle measures, and symmetry. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",

        ["(2) Number & Operations - Fractions  ", "Through their learning in the Numbers and Operations—Fractions domain, students:\n\n• develop understanding of fraction equivalence and operations with fractions;\n• recognize that two different fractions can be equal (e.g., 15/9 = 5/3), and develop methods for generating and recognizing equivalent fractions; and\n• extend previous understandings about how fractions are built from unit fractions, composing fractions from unit fractions, decomposing fractions into unit fractions, and using the meaning of fractions and the meaning of multiplication to multiply a fraction by a whole number."],
