    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Grade 7",
    "Overview": "In Grade 7, instructional time should focus on three areas: (1) developing understanding of and applying proportional relationships; (2) developing understanding of operations with rational numbers and working with expressions and linear equations; and (3) drawing inferences about populations based on samples. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Ratios & Proportional Relationships",
            "Through their learning in the Ratios and Proportional Relationships domain, students:\n\n• extend their understanding of ratios and develop understanding of proportionality to solve single- and multi-step problems;\n• use their understanding of ratios and proportionality to solve a wide variety of percent problems;\n• solve problems about scale drawings by relating corresponding lengths between the objects or by using the fact that relationships of lengths within an object are preserved in similar objects;\n• graph proportional relationships and understand the unit rate informally as a measure of the steepness of the related line; and\n• distinguish proportional relationships from other relationships."
        ],
        [
            "(2) The Number System and Expressions, Equations & Inequalities",
            "Through their learning in the Number System and the Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities domains, students:\n\n• develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a finite or a repeating decimal representation), and percents as different representations of rational numbers;\n• extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the relationships between addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division;\nn• explain and interpret the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers by applying properties of operations, and view negative numbers in terms of everyday contexts; and\n• use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one variable and use these equations to solve problems."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Statistics & Probability",
            "Through their learning in the Statistics and Probability domain, students:\n\n• build on their previous work with single data distributions to compare two data distributions and address questions about differences between populations;\n• begin informal work with random sampling to generate data sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences; and\n• extend previous understandings of simple probabilities in grade 6 to calculate probabilities of compound events."
