    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Grade 8",
    "Overview": "In Grade 8, instructional time should focus on three areas: (1) formulating and reasoning about expressions and equations, including modeling an association in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems of linear equations; (2) grasping the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships; (3) analyzing two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",

            "Through their learning in the Number System, the Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities, and the Probability and Statistics domains, students:\n\n• recognize equations for proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y = mx + b), understanding that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin;\n• understand that the slope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, as well as how the input and output change as a result of the constant rate of change;\n• interpret a model in the context of the data by expressing a linear relationship between the two quantities in question and interpret components of the relationship (such as slope and y-intercept) in terms of the situation;\n• solve systems of two linear equations in two variables and relate the systems to pairs of lines in the plane; these intersect, are parallel, or are the same line; and\n• use linear equations, systems of linear equations, linear functions, and their understanding of slope of a line to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems."

        [
            "(3) Geometry",
            "Through their learning in the Geometry domain, students:\n\n• use ideas about distance and angles, how they behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about congruence and similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems;\n• show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines give rise to similar triangles because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines;\n• understand the statement of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse, and why the Pythagorean Theorem holds; and\n• apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find distances between points on the coordinate plane, to find lengths, and to analyze polygons."
