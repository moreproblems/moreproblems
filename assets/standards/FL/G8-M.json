    "Overview": "In Grade 8, instructional time will emphasize six areas: (1) representing numbers in scientific notation and extending the set of numbers to the system of real numbers, which includes irrational numbers; (2) generate equivalent numeric and algebraic expressions including using the Laws of Exponents; (3) creating and reasoning about linear relationships including modeling an association in bivariate data with a linear equation; (4) solving linear equations, inequalities and systems of linear equations; (5) developing an understanding of the concept of a function and (6) analyzing two-dimensional figures, particularly triangles, using distance, angle and applying the Pythagorean Theorem.",
