    "Overview": "In 3rd grade, foundational reading skills are still a focus. Reading comprehension becomes a primary focus at this grade level. Students are learning how all of the elements of a text work together to create meaning and how that meaning develops in the text. Students are beginning to write in cursive and experiment with dialogue in their narrative writing. Students are doing their own research, either independently or with teacher-provided materials.",
