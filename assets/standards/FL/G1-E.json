    "Overview": "Students will continue to receive instruction in recognizing grapheme-phoneme correspondences, and they will begin decoding and encoding longer words. There is a greater focus on finding meaning in text. Students are able to identify which details are more important, a beginning step in identifying relevancy. They are also including a sense of closure in their writing.",
