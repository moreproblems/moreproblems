    "Overview": "Reading comprehension is still a focus, but analysis comes to the fore. In literary texts, students analyze how story elements contribute to the plot; in informational texts, they analyze the author’s purpose. Writing is a focus as well. Students are working to master the skills they have already learned. They are improving their organization, varying their transitions, and using elaboration effectively.",
