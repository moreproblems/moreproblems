    "Title": "Texas Essential Knowledge & Skills > Mathematics > Grade 5",
    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Grade 5 are solving problems involving all four operations with positive rational numbers, determining and generating formulas and solutions to expressions, and extending measurement to area and volume. These focal areas are supported throughout the mathematical strands of (1) number and operations, (2) algebraic reasoning, (3) geometry and measurement, and (4)data analysis. In Grade 5, the number set is limited to positive rational numbers.",

        [
            "(2) Algebraic Reasoning",
            "Students will represent and solve problems with expressions and equations, build foundations of functions through patterning, identify prime and composite numbers, and use the order of operations."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Geometry & Measurement",
            "Students will classify two-dimensional figures, connect geometric attributes to the measures of three-dimensional figures, use units of measure, and represent location using a coordinate plane."
        ],
