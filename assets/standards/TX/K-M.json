    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Kindergarten are (1) understanding counting and cardinality, (2) understanding addition as joining and subtraction as separating, and (3) comparing objects by measurable attributes.",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Understanding counting and cardinality", "Students develop number and operations through several fundamental concepts. Students know number names and the counting sequence. Counting and cardinality lay a solid foundation for number. Students apply the principles of counting to make the connection between numbers and quantities."],
        ["(2) Understanding addition as joining and subtraction as separating", "Students use meanings of numbers to create strategies for solving problems and responding to practical situations involving addition and subtraction."],
        ["(3) Comparing objects by measurable attributes", "Students identify characteristics of objects that can be measured and directly compare objects according to these measurable attributes."]
