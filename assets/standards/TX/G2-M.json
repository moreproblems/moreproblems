    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Grade 2 are (1) making comparisons within the base-10 place value system, (2) solving problems with addition and subtraction within 1,000, and (3) building foundations for multiplication.",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Making comparisons within the base-10 place value system", "Students develop an understanding of the base-10 place value system and place value concepts. The students' understanding of base-10 place value includes ideas of counting in units and multiples of thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones and a grasp of number relationships, which students demonstrate in a variety of ways."],
        ["(2) Solving problems with addition and subtraction within 1,000", "Students identify situations in which addition and subtraction are useful to solve problems. Students develop a variety of strategies to use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers."],
        ["(3) Building foundations for multiplication", "Students use the relationship between skip counting and equal groups of objects to represent the addition or subtraction of equivalent sets, which builds a strong foundation for multiplication and division."]
