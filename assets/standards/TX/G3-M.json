    "Title": "Texas Essential Knowledge & Skills > Mathematics > Grade 3",
    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Grade 3 are place value, operations of whole numbers, and understanding fractional units. These focal areas are supported throughout the mathematical strands of (1) number and operations, (2) algebraic reasoning, (3) geometry and measurement, and (4) data analysis. In Grade 3, the number set is limited to positive rational numbers.",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Number & Operations", "Students will focus on applying place value, comparing and ordering whole numbers, connecting multiplication and division, and understanding and representing fractions as numbers and equivalent fractions."],
        ["(2) Algebraic Reasoning", "Students will use multiple representations of problem situations, determine missing values in number sentences, and represent real-world relationships using number pairs in a table and verbal descriptions."],
        ["(3) Geometry & Measurement", "Students will identify and classify two-dimensional figures according to common attributes, decompose composite figures formed by rectangles to determine area, determine the perimeter of polygons, solve problems involving time, and measure liquid volume (capacity) or weight."],
        ["(4) Data Analysis", "Students will represent and interpret data."]
