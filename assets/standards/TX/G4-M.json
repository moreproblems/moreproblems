    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Grade 4 are use of operations, fractions, and decimals and describing and analyzing geometry and measurement. These focal areas are supported throughout the mathematical strands of (1) number and operations, (2) algebraic reasoning, (3) geometry and measurement, and (4) data analysis. In Grade 4, the number set is limited to positive rational numbers.",
