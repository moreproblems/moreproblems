    "Overview": "Algebra is important and useful in most careers. It is one of the most common and malleable types of mathematics, because it is valuable in a range of activities from ordinary decision making to advanced training in scientific and technological fields. The ability to understand and apply algebraic thinking is a crucial steppingstone on a successful journey in life. Algebra is a collection of unifying concepts that enable one to solve problems flexibly.",
