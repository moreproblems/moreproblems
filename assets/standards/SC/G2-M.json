    "Overview": "The focus in second grade is concentrated within the strands of Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, and Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Second graders will create an investigative question for which they will then collect data. Students will then sort, analyze, communicate, and represent these data through various charts and graphs."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Second graders will identify and write the values of coins and bills. Additionally, students will count collections of mixed coins not to exceed one dollar, while collections of mixed bills should also be counted with the total value not to exceed 100 dollars. Students will use analog and digital clocks to tell and record time in five-minute intervals. In addition, second graders will experiment with the length of objects using appropriate tools. Students will also identify, describe, classify, construct, compare, and analyze two-dimensional and three- dimensional shapes based on their attributes."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "A major emphasis is given to building number sense and place value understanding for numbers 0 to 999. Students will continue to count to combine items into groups of 10 or 100 to demonstrate place value structure. Additionally, students will use various representations to compare two numbers. Opportunities should be given to use concrete objects, drawings, and equations to demonstrate that whole numbers can be composed and decomposed in a variety of ways. Experiences should be given to allow students to use multiple ways to partition shapes into halves and fourths as a building block for fractional understanding. As a precursor to rounding, when given a two-digit number, students should identify to which multiple of 10 the number is closer."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Second graders will use multiple representations to reason and solve problems involving addition and subtraction. Students will use a variety of strategies for addition and subtraction within 100. A major focus for students in second grade will include understanding the equal sign and building a strong conceptual foundation of addition and subtraction by exploring the relationship between these operations. Multiple opportunities with concrete and pictorial models should be embedded in this strand, and students should be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations. Students will begin using arrays as an early connection between addition and multiplication. In this grade, students will also use reasoning to recognize, describe, extend, and create patterns."
