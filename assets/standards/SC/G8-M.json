    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 8",
    "Overview": "The standards for middle school continue the work started in elementary grades in these four strands: Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning. Woven throughout all four strands are concepts building on students' understanding of problem solving to provide context to the problems they are solving, which will foster critical thinking and collaboration skills.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Eighth graders will compare bivariate (two-variable) data. This is the first time that students will work with two variables simultaneously. They will use scatter plots to organize bivariate data from real-world situations. Students will describe associations among the data points in a scatter plot based on direction, form, and strength. Eighth graders will identify sample spaces and calculate and interpret the probability of compound events, using fractions, decimals, or percentages to report the probability of events."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Eighth graders will use technology to explore volume and other formulas to include the Pythagorean Theorem. The focus on right triangles will also include Pythagorean Triples and the relationship among the measures of triangles' interior and exterior angles and sums of angle measures of polygons decomposed into triangles. Eighth graders will study transformations and dilations of polygons graphed on or off the coordinate plane. Students will also study angle relationships of parallel lines. Students will also use proportional reasoning to determine congruence or similarity among polygons, finding the missing side lengths and identifying corresponding angles."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "Eighth graders will convert any form of rational numbers to other forms, which—for the first time—includes translating repeating decimals to their fraction form. This strand also has students identify the subsets of real numbers and contrast rational and irrational numbers, which will include working with perfect squares and cubes and their roots. They will write equations and inequalities to compare real numbers given in real-world settings. Students will apply the Laws of Exponents learned in seventh grade to include algebraic expressions."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Eighth graders will concentrate on functions, learning the slope-intercept form of a linear function. Students connect proportionality and linear functions together so that the constant rate of change (slope) and y-intercept can be identified and interpreted. Students will analyze multiple representations of functions to determine if they represent a linear or nonlinear function or represent a non-function. For the first time, students compare two equations to determine if they represent functions with one solution, no solution, or infinite solutions. Also, for the first time, they solve one-variable multi-step equations and inequalities with the same variable on both sides."
