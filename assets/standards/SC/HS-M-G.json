    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Geometry",
    "Overview": "Beginning high school mathematics with Geometry in ninth grade offers students the opportunity to build their reasoning and sensemaking skills, see the applicability of mathematics, and prepare more effectively for further studies in algebra. The course also focuses on statistics in analyzing data, which provides students with tools to describe, show, and summarize data in the world around them.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Probability is important because it educates one in the logic of uncertainty and randomness, which occur in almost every aspect of daily life. Therefore, studying probability structures will enhance studentsâ€™ ability to organize information and improve decision."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Students build on and deepen prior understanding of transformations, congruence, similarity, and coordinate geometry concepts. Informal explorations of transformations provide a foundation for more formal considerations of congruence and similarity, including development of criteria for triangle congruence and similarity."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "An emphasis on reasoning promotes exploration, conjecture testing, and informal and formal justification."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Students perform algebraic calculations with specific application to geometry that build on foundations of algebra from seventh and eighth grades."
