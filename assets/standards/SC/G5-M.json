    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 5",
    "Overview": "The focus in fifth grade is concentrated within the strands of Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, and Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Fifth graders will be introduced to finding the range and mode using data. Students will solve one-step problems using data represented in tables, line graphs, scaled bar graphs, or dot plots. In fifth grade, students will make predictions or draw conclusions by analyzing categorical and numerical data in graphical displays. Probability is continued to be taught in fifth grade as students will represent the likelihood of a simple event occurring in the form of a fraction."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Fifth graders will solve problems involving the area and perimeter of composite rectangles, involving whole and fractional numbers with known side lengths. Students will be introduced to the concept of volume of a right rectangular prism. In fifth grade, students will solve real-world situations requiring them to convert between measurements within different systems. Students will continue to extend their ability to estimate and measure lengths of objects. Fifth grade students will be formally introduced to the coordinate system and how this applies when plotting and labeling ordered pairs in the first quadrant. Multiple opportunities will be embedded in this strand, and students will be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "Fifth graders will represent and compare multi-digit numbers with decimals using relationships within the base ten number system and models. A major focus for students in fifth grade will include building a strong conceptual foundation of understanding decimal values. They will represent the equivalent forms of fractions as decimals and decimals as fractions as a method to compare numbers using reasoning strategies and number lines."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Fifth graders will use multiple representations to reason and solve problems involving operational properties of decimals, fractions, and whole numbers. Students will continue using a variety of strategies for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which were previously introduced in earlier grades. A major focus for students in fifth grade will include solidifying their understanding of multi-digit whole number operations to include the use of algorithms to solve problems. Completing fifth grade with knowledge of the standard algorithm for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division will lead to the ability to operate fluently with decimals and fractions in middle school. Students will also develop an understanding of operations involving fractions and decimals. Multiple opportunities with concrete and pictorial models will be embedded in this strand and students will be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations. In fifth grade, students will gain an understanding of how factors and multiples can help to determine the common denominator and simplify fractions. Students will be introduced to graphing ordered pairs within the first quadrant of a coordinate plane and they will be formally introduced to functions. It is important for students to be able to identify the rule of a function table and to extend the patterns in the table as well. In fifth grade, students will begin to use grouping symbols and learn how to evaluate numerical expressions."
