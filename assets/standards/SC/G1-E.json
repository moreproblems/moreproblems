    "Overview": "In first grade, students should continue to receive instruction in recognizing grapheme-phoneme correspondences. Students are asked to decode, or translate a word from print to speech, and encode, or translate a word from speech to print. Developing reading comprehension and fluency is also a vital skill for first graders. To support students at the first-grade level, educators are expected to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed. By the end of first grade, however, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nInstruction in first grade provides a greater focus on finding meaning in text. Students in first grade retell stories while identifying lessons within those stories. Additionally, students glean information from pictures and illustrations that accompany a print text. Students in first grade read four major types of literary texts in print and multimedia formats: fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Students also read a variety of informational texts in print and multimedia formats and begin using text features such as captions, graphs, and glossaries to locate information.\n\nThroughout first grade, students work toward mastery of writing in print and continue their exploration of opinion, informative, and narrative modes of writing at developmentally appropriate levels. First-grade students also continue practicing how to appropriately enter conversations and adjust the volume of their voices to fit the context of the conversation.",
