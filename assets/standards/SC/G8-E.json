    "Overview": "Students entering eighth grade continue to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and creativity. Eight-grade students should be reading a variety of rich and challenging texts, closely, proficiently, and independently. As in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, eighth graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nAs part of their close examination of literary text structure, eighth-grade students begin to examine how an author manipulates time to create mystery and suspense. Eighth graders move from examining an author's use of rhetorical appeals into analyzing how an author uses rhetoric in texts.\n\nEighth-grade students read a variety of fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama from across cultures and time periods. Text types should include short novels, chapter books, contemporary fiction, science fiction, and historical fiction. In addition to literary texts, instruction in eighth grade should include expository, persuasive, and informational texts that can include, but are not limited to, historical documents, news articles, speeches, personal essays, memoirs, autobiographical and biographical sketches, speeches, advertisements, primary and secondary sources, reviews, and schedules. Students should also examine documentaries, commercials, podcasts, visual performances, infographics, and other forms of multimedia texts.\n\nThroughout the year, eighth-grade students refine their written and oral communication skills to communicate to a variety of audiences. Students write shorter and longer narratives, arguments, and informational texts. In informational/expository writing, eighth graders examine multiple sources of information while using their research skills to select only those that are credible and relevant to the topic they are presenting. Eighth-grade students continue writing summary paragraphs, multi-paragraph essays, text-dependent writing, and creative pieces. As appropriate, students may also begin to explore and practice other types of college and career-ready writing such as professional emails, personal letters, public service announcements, and editorials. Lastly, students in eighth grade participate in academic discussions and communicate appropriately to a variety of audiences while considering new ideas and diverse perspectives of others.",
