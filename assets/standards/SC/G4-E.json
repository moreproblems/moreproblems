    "Overview": "In fourth grade, reading comprehension is a primary focus. Students in fourth grade are learning to make important connections within texts, such as how an author's perspective impacts his/her purpose. As in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, fourth graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nAs foundational practice for the in-depth literary analysis that will take place in later grades, fourth graders will determine and explain how key literary elements, such as conflict and setting, impact character and plot development. Additionally, fourth-grade students study plot and the ways in which it is impacted by other story elements, such as conflict. Fourth graders begin to identify and explain implied themes and central ideas, which requires students to draw conclusions based on inferences. Students are also continuing to identify organizational structures within informational text.\n\nFourth-grade students continue reading the four major types of literary texts in print and multimedia formats: fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Fourth graders also read a variety of informational texts in print and multimedia formats, as well as examine how text features contribute to the overall meaning of an informational text.\n\nThroughout fourth grade, writing instruction evolves with an emphasis on sequencing, including logical reasons, and developing an organizational structure. Students move from writing opinions to writing arguments while continuing to develop informational and narrative pieces. Fourth- grade students conduct research, refining their research questions and determining the validity of the resources they find. Students continue writing short summary paragraphs, multi-paragraph essays, text-dependent writing, and creative writing. Additionally, fourth-grade students continue to develop cursive writing.",
