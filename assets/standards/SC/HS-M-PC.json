    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Pre-Calculus",
    "Overview": "In  Pre-Calculus, students build on the conceptual knowledge and skills for mathematics they mastered in previous mathematics courses and construct a foundation necessary for subsequent mathematical study. The standards in those previous courses provide students with a foundation in the theory of functions, roots and factors of polynomials, exponential and logarithmic functions, the complex number system, and an introduction to trigonometry.",
