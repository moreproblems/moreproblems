    "Overview": "Students entering seventh grade are continuing to develop critical thinking skills, problem- solving skills, and creativity. Seventh-grade students are reading critically from a variety of rich and challenging texts, while making inferences about an author's choices and analyzing how those choices impact meaning. As in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, seventh graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on- one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nSeventh graders continue examining an author's use of the rhetorical appeals of ethos, pathos, and logos, and the types of reasoning an author uses to support claims. Students also examine how the author's choice to structure a text, literary and informational, impacts the meaning of a text.\n\nSeventh-grade students read a variety of fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama from across cultures and time periods. Text types should include short novels, chapter books, contemporary fiction, science fiction, myths, folk tales, and tall tales. In addition to literary texts, instruction in seventh grade should include expository, persuasive, and informational texts that can include, but are not limited to, historical documents, news articles, speeches, personal essays, memoirs, autobiographical and biographical sketches, speeches, advertisements, primary and secondary sources, reviews, and schedules. Students should also examine documentaries, commercials, podcasts, visual performances, infographics, and other forms of multimedia texts.\n\nThroughout the year, seventh-grade students learn how to communicate to a variety of audiences through written and oral communication. Students write shorter and longer narratives, arguments, and informational texts. In argumentative writing, seventh graders use data and statistics to support their claims while acknowledging a counterclaim. Seventh-grade students continue writing summary paragraphs, multi-paragraph essays, text-dependent writing, and creative pieces. As appropriate, students may also begin to explore and practice other types of college and career-ready writing such as professional emails, personal letters, and public service announcements. Lastly, students in seventh grade participate in academic discussions and learn how to communicate appropriately to a variety of audiences and consider new ideas and diverse perspectives of others.",
