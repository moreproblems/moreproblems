    "Overview": "Algebra II serves to deepen understanding and intuition about a wide variety of functions such as polynomial, rational, radical, exponential, and piecewise. Building on principles learned from Geometry and Algebra I, the purpose of this course is to graphically investigate and compare functions, analyze rates of change, and determine solutions of “real- world” problems at a higher conceptual level than can be achieved algebraically.",
