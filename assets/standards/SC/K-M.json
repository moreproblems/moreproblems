            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Kindergarteners will collect, sort, analyze, and communicate data through various charts and graphs."

        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Kindergarteners will identify coins and compare objects using measurement vocabulary. Students will also identify, describe, compare, and analyze 2D and 3D shapes based on their attributes."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "A major emphasis is placed on building number sense for numbers 0 to 20. Kindergarten students will focus on developing an understanding of counting to represent the total number of objects in a set. Additionally, students will use concrete representations to compare the quantity of two sets of objects. Opportunities should be provided to use concrete objects to demonstrate that whole numbers can be composed and decomposed in a variety of ways. A major focus for students in kindergarten will be subitizing quantities to 10. This ability to subitize is crucial for students, as it allows them to understand how whole numbers can be composed in numerous ways."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Kindergarteners will use multiple representations to reason and solve problems involving addition and subtraction. Students will use a variety of strategies for addition and subtraction within 10. A major focus for students in kindergarten will include building a strong conceptual foundation of addition and subtraction by exploring the relationship between these operations. Multiple opportunities with concrete and pictorial models should be embedded in this strand and students should be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations. In this grade, students will also use reasoning to extend and continue patterns."
