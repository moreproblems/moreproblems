    "Overview": "In third grade, foundational reading skills are focused on fluency; however, reading comprehension becomes the primary focus. In addition to identifying elements of literary and informational texts, students in third grade are beginning to explain how those elements function within a text.\n\nAs in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, third graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction. Instruction in third grade begins to focus on author's craft. Third-grade students begin examining an author's purpose in writing a text and explaining the differences between the perspectives of characters and the difference between the perspective of a character and of the reader.\n\nStudents in third grade continue to read the four major types of literary texts in print and multimedia formats: fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Third graders also read a variety of informational texts in print and multimedia formats as well as explain how information gleaned from visuals contributes to the meaning of a text.\n\nThroughout third grade, students compose developmentally appropriate opinion pieces, informational pieces, and narrative pieces. Within their writing, students begin structuring their thinking by grouping related ideas and using transitions to link their ideas. Third graders learn how to refine questions for research and reflect upon the ideas of others during conversations. Students practice writing short summary paragraphs, multi-paragraph essays, text-dependent writing, and creative pieces. Additionally, third-grade students begin to write in cursive.",
