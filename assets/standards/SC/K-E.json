    "Overview": "Students entering kindergarten should receive instruction characterized by a focus on explicit and systemic approaches to teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Educators are expected to offer appropriate guidance and support to students at this grade level; however, by the end of the school year, students are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators and work independently. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction. As students work toward the proficiency of the kindergarten indicators, some students may need additional guidance and support.\n\nWhile reading in kindergarten may not yet involve students independently saying words that match what is on the page, educators should consider developmental progression as students are still learning to read. Students are asked to decode, translate a word from print to speech and encode, translate a word from speech to print.\n\nIn kindergarten, students read four major types of literary texts in print and multimedia formats: fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Students also read a variety of informational texts in print and multimedia formats, as well as notice text features embedded within informational texts.\n\nAs kindergarten students begin developing print writing skills, they also begin to explore opinion, informative, and narrative modes of writing at developmentally appropriate levels. Kindergarten students experience early oral communication skills by learning to listen to others and by taking turns in conversations.",
