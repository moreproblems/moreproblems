    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 6",
    "Overview": "The standards for middle school continue the work started in elementary grades in these four strands: Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning. Woven throughout all four strands are concepts building on studentsâ€™ understanding of problem solving to provide context to the problems they are solving, which will foster critical thinking and collaboration skills.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Sixth graders will analyze data sets to identify their statistical elements. They will create graphs and plots to represent data sets, along with interpreting measures of center and spread for those data sets. They will be introduced to probability with simple and complementary events and learn that probabilities can be written as a fraction, decimal, or percent."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Sixth graders will use the characteristics of two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes learned in earlier grades to help them calculate area, surface area, and volume using models, nets, and formulas. Students will use angle measures to find and identify complementary or supplementary angles, along with exploring angles using a protractor. They will be introduced to all four quadrants of the coordinate plane and begin plotting and graphing ordered pairs in all four quadrants, to include graphing lines and polygons."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "Sixth graders will utilize multiple representations of real numbers to translate, simplify, and solve problems using mathematical and real-world applications. Students will use their prior knowledge of whole numbers to expand into operations with integers and positive rational numbers. They will deepen their understanding of fractions, decimals, and percentages through ordering, sorting, and finding absolute value. The emphasis will be on understanding negative numbers."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Sixth graders will expand their understanding of algebraic concepts, being introduced to functions. They will learn the correct terminology related to algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities, along with distinguishing between expressions and equations, and equations and inequalities. One-step simple equations and inequalities will be used to solve a variety of problems using positive rational numbers. Students will also be introduced to ratios and rates, and how to use them in real-world situations."
