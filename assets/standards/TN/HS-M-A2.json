    "Overview": "Algebra 2 further expands a student's understanding of functions and function types developed in Algebra 1. In particular, cubic, exponential, inverse, logarithmic, piecewise, and radical functions are studied. Students explore techniques for representing and solving systems of equations, including graphically, algebraically, and through the use of matrices. In addition, Algebra 2 includes a more in- depth focus on using statistics to understand data and make decisions.\n\nThroughout the course, students explore the structures of and interpret functions and other mathematical models. Algebra 2 topics will build upon previous knowledge requiring students to reason, solve, and represent mathematical concepts in multiple ways; i.e., graphically, numerically, and algebraically. Modeling and real-world problems are introduced throughout the course with standards written to encourage the use of math to answer problems students will encounter in life.",
