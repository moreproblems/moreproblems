            "(1) Operations & Algebraic Thinking",
            "Students build on their understanding of addition and subtraction to develop an understanding of the meanings of multiplication and division of whole numbers. Students use increasingly sophisticated strategies based on properties of operations to fluently solve multiplication and division problems within 100 (See Table 3 - Properties of Operations). Students interpret multiplication as finding an unknown product in situations involving equal-sized groups, arrays, area and measurement models, and division as finding an unknown factor in situations involving the unknown number of groups or the unknown group size. Students use these interpretations to represent and solve contextual problems with unknowns in all positions. By the end of 3rd grade, students should know all products of two one-digit numbers and related division facts.\n\nStudents use all four operations to solve two-step word problems and use place value, mental computation, and estimation strategies to assess the reasonableness of solutions. They build number sense by investigating numerical representations, such as addition or multiplication tables for the purpose of identifying arithmetic patterns. Students should solve a variety of problem types in order to make connections among contexts, equations, and strategies (See Table 1 - Addition and Subtraction Situations and Table 2 - Multiplication and Division Situations)."

            "(2) Number & Operations in Base Ten",
            "Students generalize place value understanding to read and write numbers to 100,000, using standard form, word form, and expanded form. Students begin to develop an understanding of rounding whole numbers to the nearest ten or hundred. Students fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms. Students multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10."

            "(3) Number & Operations In Fractions",
            "This domain builds on the previous skill of partitioning shapes in geometry. This is the first time students are introduced to unit fractions. Students understand that fractions are composed of unit fractions and they use visual fraction models to represent parts of a whole. Students build on their understanding of number lines to represent fractions as locations and lengths on a number line. Students use fractions to represent numbers equal to, less than, and greater than 1 and are able to generate simple equivalent fractions by using drawings and/or reasoning about fractions. Students understand that the size of a fractional part is relative to the size of the whole."

            "(4) Measurement & Data",
            "In 2nd grade, students tell time in five minute increments, measure lengths, and create bar graphs, pictographs, and line plots with whole number units. In 3rd grade, students tell and write time to the nearest minute and solve contextual problems involving addition and subtraction. They use appropriate tools to measure and estimate liquid volume and mass. Students draw pictographs and bar graphs and answer two-step questions about these graphs. Students generate measurement data and represent the data on line plots marked with whole number, half, or quarter units. Students recognize area as an attribute of two-dimensional shapes and measure the area of a shape using the standard unit (a square) by finding the total number of same-sized units required to cover the shape without gaps or overlaps. Students connect area to multiplication and use multiplication to justify the area of a rectangle by decomposing rectangles into rectangular arrays of squares."

            "Students understand that shapes in given categories have shared attributes and they identify polygons. Students continue their understanding of shapes and fractions by partitioning shapes into parts with equal areas and identify the parts with unit fractions."
