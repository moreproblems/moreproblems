    "Title": "Tennessee Standards > Science > Grade 1",
    "Overview": "By the end of first grade, students encounter energy of sunlight and the effects on the earth's surface. First graders experiment with light investigations to determine how different materials interact with light. Investigating plants, parts of the plant, life cycle of plants, and interdependence of plants and the surrounding environment is an essential building block toward more complex content. Students learn about patterns in the day and night sky, that the telescope and naked eye can identify celestial objects in the sky, and the patterns of earth, moon, and sun.",
