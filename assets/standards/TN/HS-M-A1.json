    "Overview": "Algebra 1 is the initial math course for high school students. It provides the foundation students require for future success in mathematics. Algebra 1 emphasizes linear and quadratic expressions, equations, inequalities, and functions. The course also introduces students to absolute value functions and exponential functions with integer exponents, especially as they compare to linear and quadratic functions. Additionally, students will work to summarize, represent, and interpret statistical data.\n\nThroughout the course, students explore the structures of and interpret functions and other mathematical models. Algebra 1 topics will build upon previous knowledge requiring students to reason, solve, and represent mathematical concepts in multiple ways; i.e., graphically, numerically, and algebraically. Modeling and real-world problems are introduced throughout the course with standards written to encourage the use of math to answer problems students will encounter in life.",
