        [
            "(1) Ratios & Proportional Relationships",
            "Students extend their understanding of ratios from 6th grade and develop understanding of proportionality to solve single- and multi-step problems. Students use this understanding to solve a wide variety of percent problems, including those involving discounts, interest, taxes, tips, and percent increase or decrease. Students solve problems about scale drawings by relating corresponding lengths between the objects or by using the fact that relationships of lengths within an object are preserved in similar objects. Students graph proportional relationships and understand the unit rate informally as a measure of the steepness of the related line. They distinguish proportional relationships from other relationships."
        ],
        [
            "(2) The Number System",
            "Students develop a unified understanding of numbers, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a finite or a repeating decimal representation), and percent as different representations of rational numbers. Students extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the relationships between addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. These properties are further explored with respect to negative numbers. This exploration is carried out in real-world problems with various contexts so that the student can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the use of mathematics in daily life."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Expressions & Equations",
            "By applying the properties of operations as strategies, students explore working with expressions, equations, and inequalities. They use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one variable and use these equations to solve multi-step real-world problems. They use variables to represent quantities and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Geometry",
            "Students continue their work with area from 6th grade, solving problems involving the area and circumference of a circle and surface area of three-dimensional objects. In preparation for work on congruence and similarity, they reason about relationships among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting lines. Students solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms."
        ],
        [
            "(5) Statistics & Probability",
            "Students continue their work from 6th grade in order to build a strong foundation for statistics and probability needed for high school. Students understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a population through sampling. They work with drawing inferences about a population based on a sample and use measures of center and of variability to draw informal comparative inferences about two populations. Students investigate the chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models. Students summarize numerical data sets with respect to their context using quantitative measures and describe any overall patterns or deviations from the overall pattern."
