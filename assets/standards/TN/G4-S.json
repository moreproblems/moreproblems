    "Title": "Tennessee Standards > Science > Grade 4",
    "Overview": "By the end of fourth grade, students develop an understanding how plants, animals, and nonliving things in an ecosystem interact with each other. They analyze temporary and permanent changes caused by weather and living things on Earth's land and water, and they investigate how the placements of certain landforms create a predictable pattern. Students examine various types of energy transfer, including sound, light, heat, and electric currents, and model how energy transforms with added speed or in a collision. They create models to explain how waves travel and how waves of light become visible to humans.",
