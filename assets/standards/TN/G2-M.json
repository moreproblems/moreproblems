    "Overview": "",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Operations & Algebraic Thinking", "Students solve one- and two-step addition and subtraction contextual problems within 100 with an unknown in any position. Students should solve a variety of problem types in order to make connections among contexts, equations, and strategies (See Table 1 - Addition and Subtraction Situations). Students also represent these problems with objects, drawings, and/or equations. Students build upon previously taught strategies to mentally add and subtract within 30. Students should know from memory all sums of two one-digit numbers and related subtraction facts."],
        ["(2) Number & Operations In Base Ten", "Students extend their understanding of the base-ten place value system to 1,000. This includes counting by ones, fives, tens, and hundreds. Students write numbers using standard form, word form, and expanded form. They deepen their understanding of different ways a number can be composed and decomposed. Students extend their understanding of place value, properties of operations, and the relationship between addition and subtraction to add and subtract within 1,000 and fluently add and subtract within 100 (See Table 3 - Properties of Operations). They add up to four two-digit numbers. They should also be able to explain why these strategies work. Students mentally add and subtract 10 or 100 to/from with a sum/difference within 1,000."],
        ["(3) Measurement & Data", "In previous grades, students measured with non-standard units. Students in 2nd grade measure with whole number standard units (centimeter and inch), and they use rulers and other measurement tools with the understanding that linear measure involves an iteration of units. They recognize that the smaller the unit, the more iterations they need to cover a given length. Students use addition and subtraction to solve contextual problems with unknowns in all positions involving lengths in the same units and represent lengths on a number line. Students expand their understanding of telling time to tell and write time in quarter hours and to the nearest 5 minutes using analog and digital clocks. Students create and use bar graphs and pictographs with up to four categories to answer addition and subtraction problems. Students are first introduced to line plots in second grade with whole number units and a given set of data. Students build on their previous work of counting the value of like coins to solving contextual problems less than one dollar involving a mixed set of coins using the Â¢ symbol appropriately as well as solving contextual problems involving whole number dollar amounts up to $100 using the $ symbol appropriately. (Decimal addition and subtraction is not introduced until 4th grade.)"],
        ["(4) Geometry", "Students describe and analyze shapes by examining their sides and angles. Students recognize and draw shapes based on given attributes, such as draw a shape with 3 vertices. Students also are able to partition circles and rectangles into two, three, and four equal shares and rectangles into rows and columns, laying the foundation for fractions and area."]
