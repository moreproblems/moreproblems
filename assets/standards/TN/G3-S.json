    "Title": "Tennessee Standards > Science > Grade 3",
    "Overview": "By the end of third grade, students analyze internal and external structures that function supporting survival along with how they adapt to their environment. Students investigate the cause and effect relationships of magnets. Students experiment with static electricity and design a device that converts energy from one form to another. Students investigate and categorize the physical properties of planets. Students synthesize different forms of data to predict and learn about weather patterns, climates, different forms of water, and how different types of clouds all contribute to weather. Students learn about natural hazards and design and test solutions to minimize the impact of these.",
