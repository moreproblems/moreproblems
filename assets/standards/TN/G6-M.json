            "(1) Ratios & Proportional Relationships",
            "6th grade begins the formal study of ratios and proportions. Students use reasoning about multiplication and division to solve ratio and rate problems about quantities. By viewing equivalent ratios and rates as deriving from, and extending, pairs of rows (or columns) in the multiplication table and by analyzing simple drawings that indicate the relative size of quantities, students connect their understanding of multiplication and division with ratios and rates. Students expand the scope of problems for which they can use multiplication and division as they connect ratios and fractions learning the similarities and the differences. Students solve a wide variety of problems involving ratios and rates. Proportional relationships are added and studied in the 7th grade and so such methods as cross multiplication should not be taught until 7th grade."

            "(2) The Number System",
            "Students make use of fractions and coupled with an understanding of the relationship between multiplication and division they learn to explain why the procedures for dividing fractions make sense. With this understanding, students are in a better position to use these operations to solve mathematical and real-world problems. Students also extend their previous understandings of numbers and the ordering of numbers to the full system of rational numbers, which includes negative rational numbers, and in particular negative integers. They reason about the order and absolute value of rational numbers and about the location of points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Expressions & Equations",
            "Students begin to use properties of arithmetic operations systematically to work with numerical expressions that contain whole number exponents. Students come to understand more fully the use of variables and variable expressions. They write expressions and equations that correspond to given situations, evaluate expressions, and use expressions and formulas to solve problems. Students understand that expressions in different forms can be equivalent, and they use the properties of operations to rewrite expressions in equivalent forms. Students know that the solutions of an equation are the values of the variables that make the equation true. Students use properties of operations and the idea of maintaining the equality of both sides of an equation to solve simple one step equations. Students explore how algebraic expressions can represent written situations and generalize relationships from specific cases."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Geometry",
            "Students build on their work with area from earlier grades by reasoning about relationships among shapes to determine area, surface area, and volume. They find areas of right triangles, other triangles, and special quadrilaterals by decomposing these shapes, rearranging or removing pieces, and relating the shapes to rectangles. Using these methods, students discuss, develop, and justify formulas for areas of triangles and parallelograms. Students find areas of polygons and surface areas of prisms and pyramids by decomposing them into pieces whose area they can more easily determine. They reason about right rectangular prisms with fractional side lengths to extend formulas for the volume of a right rectangular prism to fractional side lengths. They prepare for work on scale drawings and constructions in the 7th grade by drawing polygons in the coordinate plane."

        [
            "(5) Statistics & Probability",
            "6th grade students begin to formally develop their ability to think statistically. They understand that a set of data (collected to answer a question) will have a distribution, which can be described by its center, spread, and shape. Students calculate the median, mean, and mode and relate these to the overall shape of the distribution. They recognize that the median measures center in the sense that it is the middle value of the data and the mean measures center in that it is the numerical average of all the data points in the set. They understand that the mode refers to the most frequently occurring number found in a set of numbers and is found by collecting and organizing the data in order to count the frequency of each result. Students display, summarize and describe data sets, considering the context in which the data were collected. Students use dot plots, box plots, pie charts, and stem plots to display numerical data."
