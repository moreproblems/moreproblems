            "(1) Operations & Algebraic Thinking",
            "Students build on their understanding of patterns to generate two numerical patterns using given rules and identify relationships between the patterns. For the first time, students form ordered pairs and graph them on a coordinate plane. In addition, students write and evaluate numerical expressions using parentheses and/or brackets."

            "(2) Number & Operations In Base Ten",
            "Students generalize their understanding of place value to include decimals by reading, writing, comparing, and rounding numbers. Students explain patterns in products when multiplying a number by a power of 10. Whole-number exponents are used to denote powers of 10 for the first time. By the end of 5th grade, students should fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers (up to 4 digits by 3 digits).\n\nStudents build on their understanding of why division procedures work based on place value and the properties of operations to find whole number quotients and remainders (See Table 3 - Properties of Operations). They apply their understanding of models for decimals, decimal notation, and properties of operations to add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths. (Limit division problems so that either the dividend or the divisor is a whole number.) They develop fluency in these computations and make reasonable estimates of their results. Students finalize their understanding of multi-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with whole numbers."

        [
            "(3) Number & Operations In Fractions",
            "Students apply their understanding of equivalent fractions and fraction models to represent the addition and subtraction of fractions with unlike denominators as equivalent calculations with like denominators. They develop fluency in calculating sums and differences of fractions and make reasonable estimates of them. For the first time, students develop an understanding of fractions as division problems. They use the meaning of fractions, of multiplication and division, and the relationship between multiplication and division to understand and explain why the procedures for multiplying and dividing fractions make sense. Students reason about the size of products compared to the size of the factors. Students should solve a variety of problem types in order to make connections among contexts, equations, and strategies (See Table 1 - Addition and Subtraction Situations and Table 2 - Multiplication and Division Situations for whole number situations that can be applied to fractions)."

        [
            "(4) Measurement & Data",
            "Students build on their understanding of area and recognize volume as an attribute of three-dimensional space. They understand that volume can be measured by finding the total number of same-sized units of volume required to fill the space without gaps or overlaps. Students decompose three-dimensional shapes and find volumes of right rectangular prisms by viewing them as decomposed into layers of cubes. Students build on their understanding of measurements to convert from larger units to smaller units within a single system of measurement and solve multistep problems involving these conversions. Students solve problems with data from line plots involving fractions using operations appropriate for the grade."

            "Students plot points on the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems. Students classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties."
