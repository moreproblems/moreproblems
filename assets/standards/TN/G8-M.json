            "(1) Ratios & Proportional Relationships",
            "This is the culminating area for the number system from 6th and 7th grade with the introduction of irrational numbers. Students learn that there are numbers that are not rational, called irrational numbers, and they approximate irrational numbers by rational numbers, locating them on a number line. Students estimate the value of irrational expressions."

            "(2) The Number System",
            "Students work with radicals and integer exponents. Students understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations. Students advance their knowledge developed in 7th grade about equations to analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations. Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems. Students recognize equations for proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y = mx + b), understanding that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin. They understand that the slope, m, of a line is a constant rate of change. They understand that if the input or x- coordinate changes then the output or y-coordinate changes as well with respect to the slope. Students will solve systems of two linear equation in two variables and relate the systems to pairs of lines in the plane. They learn that these lines will either intersect, be parallel, or are actually the same line, corresponding to a single solution, no solution, or infinite solutions. Students use linear equation, systems of linear equations, linear functions, and their understanding of slope of a line to analyze situations and solve real-world and mathematical problems."

            "(3) Expressions & Equations",
            "8th grade begins the formal study of functions, a mathematical concept that for the student will continue throughout high school. Students grasp the concept of a function as a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. They understand that functions describe situations where one quantity determines another. They can translate among representations and partial representations of functions (noting that tabular and graphical representations may be partial representations), and they describe how aspects of the function are reflected in the different representations. They do not have to learn function notation at this point but they do know and interpret the equation y = mx + b as defining a linear function."

        [
            "(4) Geometry",
            "Students informally explore translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, laying groundwork for a deeper study of these in high school mathematics. Students use informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum and exterior angle of triangles. Students explain and model the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse. They apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find distances between points on the coordinate plane and to find side lengths in right triangles. Students work with volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres."

        [
            "(5) Statistics & Probability",
            "Students extend their knowledge from 7th grade by working with scatter plots for bivariate measurement data and understand linear associations and the use of linear models to solve problems interpreting the slope and intercept. Students will assess models by informally fitting a straight line and judging the closeness of the data points to the line. Students continue their work with probability from 6th and 7th grade by finding probability of compound events and represent the data using organized lists, tables, and tree diagrams."
