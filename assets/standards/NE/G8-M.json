    "Title": "Nebraska College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 8",
    "Overview": "During Grade 8, instruction should emphasize the development of the mathematical processes as the vehicle for mastering the grade-level content. Instruction should focus on these critical areas:\n• Using linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems.\n\n• Developing an understanding of irrational numbers and integer exponents.\n\n• Analyzing two-dimensional figures and solving problems using understanding of distance, angle, similarity, and congruence.\n\n• Understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n• Determining and describing rate of change and `y`-intercept for given situations.",
