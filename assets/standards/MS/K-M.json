    "Overview": "In Kindergarten, instruction should focus on two critical areas: (1) representing, relating, and operating on whole numbers- initially with sets of objects; and (2) describing shapes and space. More learning time in Kindergarten should be devoted to number than to other topics. Each critical area is described below.",
