    "Title": "Mississippi College & Career Readiness Standards > Mathematics > Grade 3",
    "Overview": "In Grade 3, instruction should focus on four critical areas: (1) developing understanding of multiplication and division and strategies for multiplication and division within 100; (2) developing understanding of fractions, especially unit fractions (fractions with a numerator of 1); (3) developing understanding of the structure of rectangular arrays and of area; and (4) describing and analyzing two-dimensional shapes. Each critical area is described below.",
