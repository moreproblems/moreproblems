    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Grade 1 are (1) understanding and applying place value, (2) solving problems involving addition and subtraction, and (3) composing and decomposing two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional solids.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Understanding and applying place value",
            "Students use relationships within the numeration system to understand the sequential order of the counting numbers and their relative magnitude."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Solving problems involving addition and subtraction",
            "Students extend their use of addition and subtraction beyond the actions of joining and separating to include comparing and combining. Students use properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction to solve problems. By comparing a variety of solution strategies, students use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to perform operations."

            "(3) Composing and decomposing two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional solids",
            "Students use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model objects in their environment and construct more complex shapes. Students are able to identify, name, and describe basic two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional solids."
