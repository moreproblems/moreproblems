    "Overview": "The primary focal areas in Grade 7 are (1) number and operations; (2) proportionality; (3) expressions, equations, and relationships; and (4) measurement and data.",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Number & Operations", "Students use concepts, algorithms, and properties of rational numbers to explore mathematical relationships and to describe increasingly complex situations."],
        ["(2) Proportionality", "Students use concepts of proportionality to explore, develop, and communicate mathematical relationships, including number, geometry and measurement, and statistics and probability. Students use algebraic thinking to describe how a change in one quantity in a relationship results in a change in the other."],
        ["(3) Expressions, Equations & Relationships", "Students connect verbal, numeric, graphic, and symbolic representations of relationships, including equations and inequalities. Students use geometric properties and relationships, as well as spatial reasoning, to model and analyze situations and solve problems."],
        ["(4) Measurement & Data", "Students communicate information about geometric figures or situations by quantifying attributes, generalize procedures from measurement experiences, and use the procedures to solve problems. Students use appropriate statistics, representations of data, and reasoning to draw conclusions, evaluate arguments, and make recommendations."]
