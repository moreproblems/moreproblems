    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 4",
    "Overview": "The focus in fourth grade is concentrated within the strands of Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, and Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Fourth graders will be introduced to collecting and organizing numerical and categorical data based on observations, surveys, and experiments. Students will interpret whole number and fractional data represented in tables, scaled bar graphs, or dot plots by solving one- step problems. Probability is continued in fourth grade and builds upon third-grade learning of representing simple events. In fourth grade, students will determine the likelihood of an event occurring. Students should be able to identify an event as impossible, equally likely, or certain. They will connect benchmark values, to connect the values of 0 to impossible and 1 to certain and equally likely to 1/2."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Fourth graders will solve real-world problems involving the perimeter and area of rectangles. Students will be asked to identify the missing side length when evaluating a perimeter scenario. Fourth grade students will be introduced to finding the area of a rectangle and labeling their units with square units. Students will also be asked to estimate and measure using multiple different units. These standards include money and elapsed time. Students will also be estimating and measuring length to the nearest quarter inch and half centimeter, to make connections between this and equivalent fractions. In fourth grade, students will classify polygons, limited to triangles and quadrilaterals, in a hierarchy based on attributes. Students will be asked to classify triangles by their side lengths and angle measures. Students will investigate attributes to help classify a shape."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "Fourth graders will use relationships within the base ten number system to represent, compare, and order whole numbers, fractions, and decimals. A major focus for students in fourth grade will be to continue building a strong conceptual understanding of fractions and part-whole relationships using models, reasoning strategies, and multiplication to generate fraction equivalencies. Students will represent and compare fractions of tenths and hundredths as decimals and decimals of tenths and hundredths in multiple ways."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Fourth graders will use multiple representations to reason and solve problems involving operational properties of whole numbers and decimals. Students will use the standard algorithm for addition and subtraction as well as a variety of previously taught strategies to accurately compute the sum or difference. Students will build on their understanding of multiplication and division concepts from third grade to operate with multi-digit problems in fourth grade. Students should decompose numbers and use multiple strategies to multiply up to four-digit numbers by one-digit numbers and two-digit by two-digit numbers. Using the inverse relationship between multiplication and division, connections should be made between these two operations. Furthermore, students should also decompose and use place value strategies to divide four-digit dividends by one-digit divisors. Students will also develop an understanding of operations involving fractions. Fractions should also be interpreted as a division scenario, where a whole or quantity is divided or partitioned into equal parts. Multiple opportunities with concrete and pictorial models should be embedded in this strand, and students should be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations. Students will begin to operate with fractions with the same denominator and decimals (limited to tenths and hundredths). It is important that students understand fractions are equal parts of a whole. When adding or subtracting fractions, students should be able to visualize combining “like terms”; therefore, fractional parts must be of the same size whole. This is essential when connecting multiplying whole numbers by unit fractions. Students can make connections to repeated addition when decomposing fractions and calculating products. Concrete models should be used when building these conceptual ideas before moving to abstract computations. Students should also use their knowledge of the four operations and number relationships to describe and extend numerical patterns following a given rule."
