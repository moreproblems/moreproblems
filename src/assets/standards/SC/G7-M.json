    "Title": "South Carolina College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 7",
    "Overview": "The standards for middle school continue the work started in elementary grades in these four strands: Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning. Woven throughout all four strands are concepts building on students' understanding of problem solving to provide context to the problems they are solving, which will foster critical thinking and collaboration skills.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Seventh graders will continue their analysis of data sets by creating and analyzing displays, including stem-and-leaf plots and histograms. Students will calculate and interpret problems using both experimental and theoretical probability. Students will make connections and understand probabilities written as fractions, decimals, and percentages."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Seventh graders will be working with two- and three-dimensional figures to solve problems involving area, surface area, and volume. Through exploration and discovery, students will develop an understanding of how to find the circumference and area of circles. This will be the first time these concepts have been introduced. Students will identify congruent angles and solve equations relating to angles formed when lines intersect. Distance between points on the coordinate plane will be found and connected back to the area and perimeter of polygons."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "Seventh graders will extend their understanding of operations to include all rational numbers, promoting student understanding of how rational numbers are used in real- world situations."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Seventh graders will expand on what was learned in sixth grade to develop an understanding of proportional relationships. Students will represent algebraic concepts using tables, graphs, verbal descriptions, and equations. Students will distinguish proportional relationships from non-proportional relationships while making the connection between unit rate and constant of proportionality. The extension of this knowledge will lead to the ability to solve single- and multi-step problems while working with expressions and linear equations. Students will be provided with multiple opportunities to solve a variety of percentage problems."
