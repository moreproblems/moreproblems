            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "Third graders will collect and analyze data and communicate through various tables, chart , and graphs. In third grade, students extend their analysis from content in second grade to scaled graphs. Probability is introduced for the first time, as students will represent the likelihood of a simple event occurring. This understanding will extend in fourth and fifth grades as students collect data from a probability experiment and record them as fractions."

            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "Third graders will solve area and perimeter problems in real-world and mathematical situations. This is the first-time students will be introduced to area and perimeter in addition to distinguishing when to use these measurements in real-world situations. A focus should include connecting area and multiplication. When determining the area, students will use squares and rectangles. When determining perimeter, students will use triangles and quadrilaterals. Students will measure customary and metric units of length. In previous grades, students have been telling tim , and this learning will now focus on third grade students determining elapsed time to the half hour and using analog and digital clocks to tell and record time in one-minute intervals. In third grade, students will continue to determine the value of collections of money greater than one dollar using coins and bills with the amount now recorded using decimal notation."

            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "Third graders will continue to represent and compare whole numbers using relationships within the base ten number system. A major focus for students in third grade will include building a strong conceptual foundation of fractions. They will represent and compare fractions based upon part-whole relationships using concrete, area, and linear models."

        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "Third graders will use multiple representations to reason and solve problems involving operational properties of whole numbers. Students will continue using a variety of strategies for addition and subtraction that have been previously introduced in earlier grades. A major focus for students in third grade will include building a strong conceptual foundation of multiplication and division by exploring the relationship between these operations. The extension of knowledge will lead to the ability to solve multi-digit problems in fourth and fifth grades. Multiple opportunities with concrete and pictorial models should be embedded in this strand, and students should be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations. In third grade, students will use reasoning to represent and solve algebraic and numerical situations involving unknowns and pattern ."
