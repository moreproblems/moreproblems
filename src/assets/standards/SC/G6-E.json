    "Overview": "Students entering sixth grade are developing critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and creativity. Sixth-grade students are reading longer texts and continuing to draw conclusions based on inferences while analyzing how an author's choices impact meaning in various types of print and multimedia texts. As in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, sixth graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nSixth graders make inferences and analyze how an author's choices impact meaning in text. Students in sixth grade are first introduced to the rhetorical appeals of ethos, pathos, and logos, and the types of reasoning an author may use to support claims.\n\nSixth-grade students read a variety of fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama from across cultures and time periods. Text types should include short novels, chapter books, contemporary fiction, science fiction, myths, folk tales, and tall tales. In addition to literary texts, instruction in sixth grade should include expository, persuasive, and informational texts that can include, but are not limited to, historical documents, news articles, speeches, personal essays, memoirs, autobiographical and biographical sketches, speeches, advertisements, primary and secondary sources, reviews, and schedules. Students should also examine documentaries, commercials, podcasts, visual performances, infographics, and other forms of multimedia texts.\n\nThroughout the year, sixth-grade students learn how to communicate to a variety of audiences through written and oral communication. Students write shorter and longer narratives, arguments, and informational texts. Sixth graders continue to strengthen the organizational structure of their writing while using details and reasons to develop their thoughts. Sixth-grade students continue writing summary paragraphs, multi-paragraph essays, text-dependent writing, and creative pieces. When appropriate, students may also begin to explore and practice other types of college and career-ready writing such as professional emails and personal letters. Lastly, students in sixth grade participate in academic discussions and learn how to communicate appropriately to a variety of audiences.",
