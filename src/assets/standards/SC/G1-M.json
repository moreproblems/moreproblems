    "Overview": "The focus in first grade is concentrated within the strands of Data, Probability, and Statistical Reasoning; Measurement, Geometry, and Spatial Reasoning; Numerical Reasoning; and Patterns, Algebra, and Functional Reasoning.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Data, Probability &  Statistical Reasoning",
            "First graders will create an investigative question for which they will then collect data. Students will then sort, analyze, and communicate these data through various charts and graphs."

            "(2) Measurement, Geometry & Spatial Reasoning",
            "First graders will identify coins and bills by name and value. Additionally, students will count collections of like coins not to exceed one dollar. Students will begin telling time to the hour on analog and digital clocks. Students will also identify, describe, classify, construct, compare, and analyze two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes based on their attributes."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Numerical Reasoning",
            "A major emphasis is given to building number sense and place value understanding for numbers 0 to 100. Students will continue to count, combining items into groups of 10 to demonstrate place value structure. Additionally, students will use various representations to compare two numbers. Opportunities should be given to use concrete objects, drawings, and equations to demonstrate that whole numbers can be composed and decomposed in a variety of ways. Experiences should be given to allow students to partition shapes into equal parts as a building block for fractional understanding."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Patterns, Algebra &  Functional Reasoning",
            "First graders will use multiple representations to reason and solve problems involving addition and subtraction. Students will use a variety of strategies for addition and subtraction within 100. A major focus for students in first grade will include understanding the equal sign and building a strong conceptual foundation for addition and subtraction by exploring the relationship between these operations. Multiple opportunities with concrete and pictorial models should be embedded in this strand, and students should be able to apply the concepts to mathematical and real-world situations. In first grade, students will also use reasoning to create, describe, and extend patterns."
