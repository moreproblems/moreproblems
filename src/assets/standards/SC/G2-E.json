    "Overview": "By second grade, students should have mastered print concepts and phonological awareness. The foundational skills emphasized at the second- grade level are phonics and fluency. Second-grade students are asked to decode, translate a word from print to speech and encode, translate a word from speech to print. It is also vital that students continue to develop comprehension and fluency in reading.\n\nAs in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, second graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nInstruction in second grade provides a greater focus on finding meaning in text. Second-grade students are beginning to explain how features or elements of text contribute to meaning. Students are also asking “who, what, when, where, why, and how” questions to explain an author’s purpose in writing a text.\n\nIn second grade, students read four major types of literary texts in print and multimedia formats: fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Second-grade students also read a variety of informational texts in print and multimedia formats.\n\nThroughout second grade, students work toward mastery of print writing and continue exploring opinion, informative, and narrative modes of writing at developmentally appropriate levels. Second-grade students continue to practice entering conversations appropriately and should continue to practice adjusting the volume of their voices to fit the context of conversations.\n\nSecond graders write narratives that include temporal words and opinions that include supporting details. Also in their writing, second-grade students are learning how to develop a topic with facts and details.",
