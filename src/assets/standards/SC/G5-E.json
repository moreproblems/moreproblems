    "Overview": "Students entering fifth grade are developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. While reading comprehension is still a focus in fifth grade, analysis is beginning to emerge. For example, students should be able to identify and describe how conflict within a story moves a plot forward using both supporting evidence and elaboration. As in previous grades, educators should continue to offer appropriate guidance and support to students as needed; however, by the end of the school year, fifth graders are expected to demonstrate proficiency of the grade-level indicators with independence. Examples of guidance and support might include, but are not limited to, one-on-one instruction, small group instruction, reteaching, prompting, and differentiated instruction.\n\nIn literary texts, fifth graders begin to analyze how story elements contribute to the plot. Additionally, students should be able to explain how the point of view through which a story is told can impact how events are described, remembering that point of view focuses on who is telling the story. Fifth-grade students are also expected to describe how an author reveals one or more characters’ perspectives, remembering that perspective is how characters view and process what is happening in the story. In informational texts, students begin to compare and contrast primary and secondary accounts of the same event or topic.\n\nFifth-grade students read four major types of literary texts in print and multimedia formats: fiction, literary nonfiction, poetry, and drama. Students also read a variety of informational texts in print and multimedia formats, as well as text features embedded within informational texts.\n\nThroughout fifth grade, students work toward proficiency of the skills they have learned and developed. Writing skills continue to evolve as students strengthen arguments and informational pieces by developing organizational structures to logically group ideas. In narrative writing, students work to vary transitions, organize thoughts, and use elaboration more effectively. In oral communications, students begin to evaluate a speaker’s claims. In their own oral communications, fifth graders consider and reflect upon the thoughts and ideas of others. Fifth- grade students continue writing summary paragraphs, multi-paragraph essays, text-dependent writing, and creative pieces.",
