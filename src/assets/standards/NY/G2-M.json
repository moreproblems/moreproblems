    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Grade 2",
    "Overview": "In Grade 2, instructional time should focus on four areas: (1) extending understanding of base-ten notation; (2) building fluency with addition and subtraction; (3) using standard units of measure; and (4) analyzing and classifying two dimensional shapes as polygons or non-polygons. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",

        [
            "(1) Number & Operations In Base Ten",
            "Through their learning in the Number and Operations in Base Ten domain, students:\n\n• extend their understanding of the base-ten system. This includes ideas of counting in fives, tens, and multiples of hundreds, tens, and ones, as well as number relationships involving these units, including comparing; and\n• understand multi-digit numbers (up to 1000) written in base-ten notation, recognizing that the digits in each place represent amounts of thousands, hundreds, tens, or ones (e.g., 853 is 8 hundreds + 5 tens + 3 ones)."

            "(2) Operations & Algebraic Thinking and Number & Operations In Base ",
            "Through their learning in the Operations and Algebraic Thinking and Numbers and Operations in Base Ten domains, students:\n\n• use their understanding of addition to develop fluency with addition and subtraction within 100;\n• solve problems within 1000 by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction, and they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in base-ten notation, using their understanding of place value and the properties of operations; and\n• select and accurately apply methods that are appropriate for the context and the numbers involved to mentally calculate sums and differences for numbers with only tens or only hundreds."

        [
            "(3) Measurement & Data",
            "Through their learning in the Measurement & Data domain, students:\n\n• recognize the need for standard units of measure (centimeter and inch) and use rulers and other measurement tools with the understanding that linear measure involves an iteration of units; and\n• recognize that the smaller the unit, the more iterations needed to cover a given length."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Geometry",
            "Through their learning in the Geometry domain, students:\n\n• describe and classify shapes as polygons or non-polygons;\n• investigate, describe, and reason about decomposing and combining shapes to make other shapes; and\n• draw, partition, and analyze two-dimensional shapes to develop a foundation for understanding area, congruence, similarity, and fractions in later grades."
