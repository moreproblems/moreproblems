    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Grade 5",
    "Overview": "In Grade 5, instructional time should focus on three areas: (1) developing fluency with addition and subtraction of fractions, and developing understanding of the multiplication of fractions and of division of fractions in limited cases (unit fractions divided by whole numbers and whole numbers divided by unit fractions); (2) extending division to 2-digit divisors, integrating decimals into the place value system and developing understanding of operations with decimals to hundredths, and developing fluency with whole number and decimal operations; and (3) developing understanding of volume. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",

(note: this is limited to the case of dividing unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.)"
