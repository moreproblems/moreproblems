    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Grade 6",
    "Overview": "In Grade 6, instructional time should focus on five areas: (1) connecting ratio and rate to whole number multiplication and division and using concepts of ratio and rate to solve problems; (2) completing understanding of division of fractions and extending the notion of number to the system of rational numbers, which includes negative numbers; (3) writing, interpreting, and using expressions and equations; (4) deepening understanding of area, surface area and volume; and (5) developing understanding of simple probabilities and statistical thinking. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Ratios & Proportional Relationships", "Through their learning in the Ratios and Proportional Relationships domain, students:\n\n• use reasoning about multiplication and division to solve ratio and rate problems about quantities;\n• connect understanding of multiplication and division with ratios and rates by viewing equivalent ratios and rates as deriving from, and extending, pairs of rows (or columns) in the multiplication table, and by analyzing simple drawings that indicate the relative size of quantities; and\n• expand the scope of problems for which they can use multiplication and division to solve problems, and they connect ratios and fractions."],
        ["(2) The Number System", "Through their learning in the Number System domain, students:\n\n• use the meaning of fractions and relationships between multiplication and division to understand and explain why the procedures for dividing fractions make sense;\n• extend their previous understandings of number and the ordering of numbers to the full system of rational numbers, which includes negative rational numbers, particularly negative integers; and\n• reason about the order and absolute value of rational numbers and about the location of points on a coordinate plane."],
        ["(3) Expressions, Equations & Inequalities", "Through their learning in the Expressions, Equations, and Inequalities domain, students:\n\n• write expressions and equations that correspond to given situations, using variables to represent an unknown and describe relationships between quantities;\n• understand that expressions in different forms can be equivalent, and use the properties of operations to rewrite and evaluate expressions in equivalent forms; and\n• use properties of operations and the idea of maintaining the equality of both sides of an equation to solve simple one-step equations."],
        ["(4) Geometry ", "Through their learning in the Geometry domain, students:\n\n• find areas of polygons, surface areas of prisms, and use area models to understand perfect squares; and\n• extend formulas for the volume of a right rectangular prism to fractional side lengths and use volume models to understand perfect cubes."],
        ["(5) Statistics & Probability", "Through their learning in the Statistics and Probability domain, students:\n\n• learn to describe and summarize numerical data sets, identifying clusters, peaks, gaps, and symmetry, considering the context in which the data were collected; and\n• understand the probability of a chance event and develop probability models for simple events."]
