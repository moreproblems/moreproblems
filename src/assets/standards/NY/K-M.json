    "Title": "New York State Next Generation Standards > Mathematics > Kindergarten",
    "Overview": "In Kindergarten, instructional time should focus on two areas: (1) developing a sound sense of numbers by representing and comparing numbers, initially using sets of objects; (2) recognizing and describing shapes and using spatial relations. More learning time in Kindergarten should be devoted to number than to any other topic. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",
    "Goals": [
        [
            "(1) Counting & Cardinality and Operations & Algebraic Thinking",
            "Through their learning in the Counting and Cardinality and Operations and Algebraic Thinking domains, students:\n\n• develop a more formal sense of numbers;\n• use numbers, including written numerals, to represent quantities and to solve quantitative problems, such as counting objects in a set; counting out a given number of objects; comparing sets or numerals; and modeling simple joining and separating situations with sets of objects, or eventually with equations such as 5 + 2 = 7 and 7 – 2 = 5. Note: Kindergarten students should see addition and subtraction equations, and student writing of equations in kindergarten is encouraged, but it is not required; and\n• choose, combine, and apply effective strategies for answering quantitative questions, including quickly recognizing the cardinalities of small sets of objects, counting and producing sets of given sizes, counting the number of objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objects that remain in a set after some are taken away."

        [
            "(2) Geometry and Measurement & Data",
            "Through their learning in the Geometry and Measurement & Data domains, students:\n\n• describe their physical world using geometric ideas (e.g., shape, orientation, spatial relations) and appropriate vocabulary;\n• identify, name, and describe basic two-dimensional shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, rectangles, and hexagons, presented in a variety of ways (e.g., with different sizes and orientations), as well as three-dimensional shapes such as cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres;\n• use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model objects in their everyday environment to create and compose more complex shapes; and\n• explore* coins and begin identifying of pennies and dimes."
