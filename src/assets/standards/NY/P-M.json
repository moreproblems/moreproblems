    "Title": "New York Next Generation > Mathematics > Pre-Kindergarten",
    "Overview": "In Pre-Kindergarten, instructional time should focus on two areas: (1) developing a good sense of numbers using concrete objects including concepts of correspondence, counting, cardinality, and comparison; (2) describing shapes in their everyday environment. More learning time in Pre-Kindergarten should be devoted to exploring* and developing the sense of numbers than any other topic. Please note that while every standard/topic in the grade level has not been included in this overview, all standards should be included in instruction.",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Counting & Cardinality", "Through their learning in the Counting and Cardinality domain, students:\n\n• develop a sense of numbers and count to determine the number of objects;\n• understand that number words refer to quantity;\n• use 1:1 correspondence to solve problems by matching sets and comparing number amounts and in counting objects to 10 through a variety of experiences; and\n• understand that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted (cardinality) and they count to determine number amounts and compare quantities (using language such as more than, fewer than, or equal to (the same as) the number of objects in another group)."],
        ["(2) Geometry and Measurement & Data", "Through their learning in the Geometry and Measurement & Data domains, students:\n\n• describe the position of objects in space based on the relations of those objects (e.g., shape and special relations) using appropriate vocabulary;\n• identify and name basic two-dimensional shapes, such as triangles, rectangles, squares, and circles; and\n• use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model objects in their everyday environment."]
