    "Overview": "By the end of Kindergarten, students are introduced to matter and its interactions by constructing experiments with solids and liquids. Students make connections and use senses by classifying observable properties of matter and classifying living and nonliving things. Throughout the year, Kindergarten students use their observation skills to identify weather patterns and seasons. Students also use observations and evidence to identify the relationship between earth and human activities.",
