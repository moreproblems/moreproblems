    "Title": "Tennessee Standards > Science > Grade 5",
    "Overview": "By the end of fifth grade, students explore Earth's materials and systems. They use models and data to investigate factors that affect climate and the cycling of water. Students investigate the distribution and role of the Earth's water. Students should explain the impact on earth's resources and climate when analyzing relationships between humans and the environment. Students examine inherited traits and variations and how these variations lead to species survival. In physical science, they learn about physical properties of matter and chemical reactions by discovering matter is not destroyed, only changed. Investigating forces and motion, students focus on balanced and unbalanced forces and explore patterns of change in physical systems along with gravitational forces.",
