    "Overview": "",
    "Goals": [
        ["(1) Operations & Algebraic Thinking", "Students build on their knowledge of multiplication and begin to interpret and represent multiplication as a comparison. They multiply and divide to solve contextual problems involving multiplicative situations, distinguishing their solutions from additive comparison situations. Students solve multi-step whole number contextual problems using the four operations representing the unknown as a variable within equations (See Table 1 - Addition and Subtraction Situations and Table 2 - Multiplication and Division Situations). This is the first time students find and interpret remainders in context. Students find factors and multiples, and they identify prime and composite numbers. Students generate number or shape patterns following a given rule."],
        ["(2) Number & Operations In Base Ten", "Students generalize place value understanding to read and write numbers to 1,000,000, using standard form, word form, and expanded notation. They compare the relative size of the numbers and round numbers to the nearest hundred thousand, which builds on 3rd grade rounding concepts. By the end of 4th grade, students should fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers to 1,000,000. Students use strategies based on place value and the properties of operations to multiply a whole number up to four-digits by a one-digit number, and multiply two two-digit numbers. They use these strategies and the relationship between multiplication and division to find whole number quotients and remainders up to four-digit dividends and one-digit divisors (See Table 3 - Properties of Operations)."],
        ["(3) Number & Operations In Fractions", "Students continue to develop an understanding of fraction equivalence by reasoning about the size of the fractions, using a benchmark fraction to compare the fractions, or finding a common denominator. Students extend previous understanding of unit fractions to compose and decompose fractions in different ways. They use the meaning of fractions and the meaning of multiplication as repeated addition to multiply a whole number by a fraction. Students solve contextual problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators and multiplication of a whole number by a fraction (See Table 1 - Addition and Subtraction Situations and Table 2 - Multiplication and Division Situations for whole number situations that can be applied to fractions). Students learn decimal notation for the first time to represent fractions with denominators of 10 and 100. They express these fractions and their equivalents as decimals and are able to read, write, compare, and locate these decimals on a number line."],
        ["(4) Measurement & Data", "Students know the relative sizes of measurement units within one system of units. They use the four operations to solve contextual problems involving measurement. Students build on their previous understanding of area and perimeter to generate and apply formulas for finding the area and perimeter of rectangles. Students also build on their understanding of line plots and solve problems involving fractions using operations appropriate for the grade. For the first time, students learn concepts of angle measurement."],
        ["(5) Geometry", "Students extend their previous understanding to analyze and classify shapes based on line and angle types. Students also use knowledge of line and angle types to identify right triangles. Students recognize and draw lines of symmetry for the first time."]
