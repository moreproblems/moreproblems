        [
            "(1) Counting & Cardinality",
            "Students use numbers, including written numerals and counting, to develop concepts about quantity. Students use numbers to solve contextual problems and represent quantities, such as counting objects in a set, counting out a given number of objects, and comparing sets or numerals. Students use effective strategies for counting and answering quantitative questions, including quickly recognizing the cardinalities of small sets of objects and learning about counting sequences."
        ],
        [
            "(2) Operations & Algebraic Thinking",
            "Students develop an understanding of addition and subtraction and determine when to add or subtract in a given context. Students should solve a variety of problem types in order to make connections among contexts, equations, and strategies (See Table 1 - Addition and Subtraction Situations). Students choose from multiple representations (including using objects, fingers, mental images, drawings, sounds, acting out situations, verbal explanations, expressions, or equations) when solving addition and subtraction problems within 10. Students compose and decompose quantities within 10 in various ways, and use mental strategies flexibly to develop fluency in addition and subtraction within 10."
        ],
        [
            "(3) Number & Operations In Base Ten",
            "Students understand that numbers from 11 to 19 represent ten ones and some more ones by using objects or drawings, and record each composition or decomposition by a drawing and/or write an equation to represent this relationship."
        ],
        [
            "(4) Measurement & Data",
            "Students describe and sort objects in many different ways. This includes length, weight, and coins. They classify objects in categories and compare measurable attributes. Students begin to learn to graph and analyze collections of objects. Students learn to identify the penny, nickel, dime, and quarter and know the value of each."
        ],
        [
            "(5) Geometry",
            "Students describe their physical world using geometric ideas, vocabulary, and positional words. Regardless of orientation, students name two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional solids, compare shapes/solids, and combine shapes/solids to create new shapes/solids. Students will recognize, describe, extend, and create patterns and explain patterning rules and the structure of patterns."
