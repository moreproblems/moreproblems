    "Title": "Tennessee Academic Standards > Mathematics > Geometry",
    "Overview": "Geometry emphasizes congruence, similarity, right triangle trigonometry, coordinate geometry, and modeling geometry concepts in real life situations. This course also introduces students to geometric constructions. Student extend their understanding of surface area and volume from previous grade levels by using unit analysis and the coordinate plane to solve problems in the real world. Finally, this course further develops student use of visual representations to understand and compute probabilities.\n\nThroughout the course, students build upon previous knowledge to justify relationships, reason mathematically, and solve problems. Modeling and real-world problems are introduced throughout the course with standards written to encourage the use of math to answer problems students will encounter in life.",
