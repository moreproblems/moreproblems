        "EOverview": "Meaningful and relevant assessments work hand in hand with rigorous academic standards. State tests, known as the Colorado Measures of Academic Success (CMAS), measure students' mastery of the standards and the complex thinking and other critical skills students need to be successful in school and in life. The data from assessments is critical in determining if educational goals are being met and if students are on track to graduate prepared for college and career.\n\nCMAS is the state's common measurement of students' progress at the end of the school year in English language arts, math and science. Students in grades three through eight take the CMAS tests in math and English language arts. Students in fifth, eighth and 11th grades take the CMAS science assessment.",
        "SOverview": "The Colorado Academic Standards are the expectations of what students need to know and be able to do at the end of each grade. They also stand as the values and content organizers of what Colorado sees as the future skills and essential knowledge for our next generation to be more successful. All Colorado districts are required to adopt local standards that meet or exceed the Colorado Academic Standards.\n\nColorado has academic standards in eight content areas for preschool through 12th grade: Arts (includes Drama/Theater Arts), Music, Dance, Visual Arts, Comprehensive Health & Physical Education, Computer Science, Mathematics, Reading, Writing & Communicating, Science, Social Studies (includes Personal Financial Literacy), World Languages."
