    "Overview": "During Grade 6, instruction should emphasize the development of the mathematical processes as the vehicle for mastering the grade-level content. Instruction should focus on these critical areas:\n• Connecting ratio and rate to whole number multiplication and division and using concepts of ratio and rate to solve problems.\n• Completing computational understanding with the division of fractions and moving towards efficiency by using the algorithm for each operation.\n• Extending understanding of the number line to include the entire system of rational numbers, which now includes negative numbers.\n• Writing and using expressions and equations\n• Representing data in multiple ways in order to analyze and interpret the results.",
