    "Title": "Nebraska College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 1",
    "Overview": "During Grade 1, instruction should emphasize the development of the mathematical processes as the vehicle for mastering the grade- level content. Instruction should focus on these critical areas:\n• Extending the counting sequence and strategies for solving quantitative questions.\n\n• Representing and solving problems involving addition and subtraction to include work with equations and the properties of the operations.\n\n• Developing understandings of addition and subtraction strategies for basic addition facts and related subtraction facts.\n\n• Developing an understanding of whole number relationships, including grouping in tens and ones.\n\n• Measuring lengths indirectly and by iterating length units.",
