    "Title": "Nebraska College & Career Ready Standards > Mathematics > Grade 2",
    "Overview": "During Grade 2, instruction should emphasize the development of the mathematical processes as the vehicle for mastering the grade- level content. Instruction should focus on these critical areas:\n• Building on base-ten numeration system and place-value concepts to demonstrate understanding of multi-digit numbers.\n\n• Applying properties of operations and the relationship between adding and subtracting.\n\n• Developing quick recall of addition facts and related subtraction facts.\n\n• Solving problems that involve time and/or money.\n\n• Extending understanding of linear measurement by measuring and estimating lengths and relating length to addition and subtraction.",
