    "Overview": "Students should have mastered print concepts and phonological awareness. The foundational skills emphasized at this grade level are phonics and fluency. The concept of theme is introduced in 2nd grade, building on the finding of a moral from 1st grade. Author’s purpose is introduced for informational text. Students are now printing legibly and writing narratives that include transitional words.",
