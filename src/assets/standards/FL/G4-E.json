    "Overview": "In 4th grade, reading comprehension is still a primary focus. An important distinction between narrator point of view and character perspective is addressed. Writing instruction increases and logical reasons, sequencing, and organization are emphasized. Students study plot and the ways in which it is impacted by other story elements. This is also the first time students are working with implied themes. Problem and solution and description are added as text structures for informational text. Students are also determining which sources in their research are valid.",
