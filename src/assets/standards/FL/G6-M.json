    "Title": "Florida Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking > Mathematics > Grade 6",
    "Overview": "In Grade 6, instructional time will emphasize five areas: (1) performing all four operations with integers, positive decimals and positive fractions with procedural fluency; (2) exploring and applying concepts of ratios, rates and percent to solve problems; (3) creating, interpreting and using expressions and equations; (4) extending geometric reasoning to plotting points on the coordinate plane, area and volume of geometric figures and (5) extending understanding of statistical thinking.",
