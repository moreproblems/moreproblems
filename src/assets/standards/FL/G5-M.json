    "Overview": "In Grade 5, instructional time will emphasize five areas: (1) multiplying and dividing multi-digit whole numbers, including using a standard algorithm; (2) adding and subtracting fractions and decimals with procedural fluency, developing an understanding of multiplication and division of fractions and decimals; (3) developing an understanding of the coordinate plane and plotting pairs of numbers in the first quadrant; (4) extending geometric reasoning to include volume and (5) extending understanding of data to include the mean.",
