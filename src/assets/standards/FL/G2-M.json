    "Overview": "In Grade 2, instructional time will emphasize four areas: (1) extending understanding of place value in three-digit numbers; (2) building fluency and algebraic reasoning with addition and subtraction; (3) extending understanding of measurement of objects, time and the perimeter of geometric figures and (4) developing spatial reasoning with number representations and two-dimensional figures.",
