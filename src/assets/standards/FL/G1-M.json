    "Overview": "In Grade 1, instructional time will emphasize four areas: (1) understanding the place value of tens and ones within two-digit whole numbers; (2) extending understanding of addition and subtraction and the relationship between them; (3) developing an understanding of measurement of physical objects, money and time and (4) categorizing, composing and decomposing geometric figures.",
