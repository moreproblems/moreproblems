    "Overview": "In Grade 3, instructional time will emphasize four areas: (1) adding and subtracting multi-digit whole numbers, including using a standard algorithm; (2) building an understanding of multiplication and division, the relationship between them and the connection to area of rectangles; (3) developing an understanding of fractions and (4) extending geometric reasoning to lines and attributes of quadrilaterals.",
