    "Overview": "In Kindergarten, instructional time will emphasize three areas: (1) developing an understanding of counting to represent the total number of objects in a set and to order the objects within a set; (2) developing an understanding of addition and subtraction and the relationship of these operations to counting and (3) measuring, comparing and categorizing objects according to various attributes, including their two- and three-dimensional shapes.",
