    "Title": "Florida Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking > Mathematics > Grade 7",
    "Overview": "In Grade 7, instructional time will emphasize five areas: (1) recognizing that fractions, decimals and percentages are different representations of rational numbers and performing all four operations with rational numbers with procedural fluency; (2) creating equivalent expressions and solving equations and inequalities; (3) developing understanding of and applying proportional relationships in two variables; (4) extending analysis of two- and three-dimensional figures to include circles and cylinders and (5) representing and comparing categorical and numerical data and developing understanding of probability.",
