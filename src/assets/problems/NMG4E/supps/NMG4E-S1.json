        ["1", "NARRATOR 1: There once was an old farmer who had three sons. The oldest son was named Hans. Fritz was the middle son, and the youngest was called Kurt. The farmer loved his boys dearly and they worked beside each other every day doing the endless chores that needed to be done on the farm."],
        ["2", "HANS: My jobs require great skill with animals. I milk the cows, shear the sheep, and feed the pigs."],
        ["3", "FRITZ: I am a plant specialist. I plow the fields, sow the seed, and reap the harvest."],
        ["4", "KURT: I do all the jobs that are left. I churn the butter, wash the clothes, and make the candles. Blech!"],
        ["5", "NARRATOR 2: Sometimes Kurt longed to help his older brothers."],
        ["6", "FARMER: Boys, gather around. I have finally figured out a fair way to choose which of you will inherit my farm. Here is my plan. We will pick one day. Each of you will have a turn to fill up the old barn before that day is done. Whoever can a͟c͟c͟o͟m͟p͟l͟i͟s͟h this task will have the farm."],
        ["7", "HANS: But what shall we use to fill it?"],
        ["8", "FARMER: Whatever you choose. Does that sound fair?"],
        ["9", "HANS, FRITZ, KURT: Yes, Father."],
        ["10", "NARRATOR 2: As the boys went about their chores that day, each thought about how he would fill the barn."],
        ["11", "HANS: With my skills with the animals, I cannot lose."],
        ["12", "FRITZ: No one knows more about crops than I. Soon this farm will be mine."],
        ["13", "KURT: I have no good ideas. I must not get discouraged though, or I will never win the farm. I have to keep thinking."],
        ["14", "NARRATOR 3: At last the day of the contest arrived. Everyone was up at dawn."],
        ["15", "HANS: Of course, since I am oldest, I will go first. Stand aside everyone."],
        ["16", "NARRATOR 1: And with great skill, Hans packed every last farm animal into the barn. There was not enough room for even one more chicken on the barn floor that was packed full of horses, cows, sheep, pigs, and cats."],
        ["17", "HANS: It looks like the farm will be mine, brother Fritz."],
        ["18", "FRITZ: We shall see. First, I will lead all the animals out of the barn. And now, hand me a pitchfork, Kurt."],
        ["19", "NARRATOR 2: And Fritz proceeded to fill the barn to the rafters with hay."],
        ["20", "FRITZ: Now who do you think will win the farm, older brother?"],
        ["21", "FATHER: Fritz, you have certainly filled the barn more than Hans did, but don't forget about Kurt. We must give your younger brother his chance."],
        ["22", "NARRATOR 3: The three boys cleared all the hay out of the barn. By the time they had finished, night had fallen."],
        ["23", "HANS: Your turn, baby brother."],
        ["24", "FRITZ: Let us see what you can do in the time that's left."],
        ["25", "NARRATOR 1: Kurt spoke not a word. He simply reached into the pocket of his overalls. He pulled out a candle and lit it. Immediately, light filled the barn. It reached past the beams and rafters to the roof and spilled out the windows and doors."],
        ["26", "HANS: Amazing!"],
        ["27", "FRITZ: I cannot believe it. You did it!"],
        ["28", "FATHER: There is no doubt, Kurt. You have won the farm!"],
        ["29", "KURT: Thank you, Father. I am very grateful. But I don't want to live on this big farm all by myself. I want to shear the sheep and reap the harvest with my brothers. And I want my brothers to wash the clothes and churn the butter with me. Agreed?"],
        ["30", "NARRATOR 2: So the three brothers agreed to share the farm and housework and they lived happily together on the farm for the rest of their lives."]
