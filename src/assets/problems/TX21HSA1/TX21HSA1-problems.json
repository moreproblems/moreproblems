As the graph of the parabola opens downward, the maximum value should be identified as 7.66 because the vertex (high point of the curve) (1.25, 7.66) is the same distance horizontally from the points (1.00, 7.35) and (1.50, 7.35), which means the vertex must be halfway between the two points. The graph of the parabola is bounded below at 0, or ground level, because the distance from the ground can only be represented by 0 and positive numbers. Therefore, the range for this situation can be described as all real numbers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 7.66.

Since parallel lines have the same slope, the student could have substituted m = −8/3 into the slope-intercept form, resulting in y = (−8/3)x + b. To determine b, the student could have substituted the point (6, −1) for x and y in the slope-intercept form, resulting in −1 = (−8/3)(6) + b. The student could have then multiplied −8/3 by 6, resulting in −1 = −16 + b. To solve the equation for b, the student could have added 16 to both sides of the equation, resulting in 15 = b. Substituting the value of b into the slope-intercept form results in y = (−8/3)x + 15. To convert the equation from slope-intercept form to standard form, the student could have first multiplied both sides of the equation by 3, resulting in 3y = −8x + 45, and then added 8x to both sides of the equation, resulting in 8x + 3y = 45.
