Therefore, the first and second equations represent the same line in the xy-plane. If the x- and y-coordinates of a point satisfy an equation, the point lies on the graph of the equation in the xy-plane. Choice A is a point with x-coordinate r and y-coordinate -8r/7 + 9/7. Substituting r for x and -8r/7 + 9/7 for y in the equation 8x + 7y = 9 yields 8r + 7(-8r/7 + 9/7) = 9. Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of this equation yields 8r - 8r + 9 = 9. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields 9 = 9, so the coordinates of the point (r, -8r/7 + 9/7) satisfy both equations in the given system. Therefore, for each real number r , the point (r, -8r/7 + 9/7) lies on the graph of each equation in the xy-plane for the given system.",

It's also given that the salesperson has a goal for the total earnings to be at least 3 times and at most 4 times the base salary, which can be represented by the expressions 3x and 4x , respectively. Therefore, this situation can be represented by the inequality 3x ≤ x + 0.11 ≤ 4x. Subtracting x from each part of this inequality yields 2x ≤ 0.11 ≤ 3x. Dividing each part of this inequality by 0.11 yields 2 3 2x/0.11 ≤ s ≤ 3x/0.11.

It's also given that the number c is 60% greater than a. Therefore, c = (1 + 60/100)a, which is equivalent to c = (1 + 0.60)a, or c = 1.60a. Since a = 0.30b, substituting 0.30b for a in the equation 1.60 c a = yields c = 1.60(0.30b), or c = 0.48b. Thus, c is 0.48 times b.
