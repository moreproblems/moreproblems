        ["1", "\tOnce upon a time, a long while ago, the Sun, the Wind, and the Moon were three sisters, and their mother was a pale, lovely Star that shone, far away, in the dark evening sky."],
        ["2", "\tOne day their uncle and aunt, Thunder and Lightning, asked the three sisters to have supper with them, and their mother said that they might go. She would wait for them, she said, and would not set until all three returned and told her about their pleasant visit."],
        ["3", "\tSo the Sun, the Wind, and the Moon started out for the party with the Thunder and Lightning. Oh, it was a supper to remember! The table was spread with a cloth of rainbow. There were ices like the snow on the mountain tops, cakes as soft and white as clouds, and fruits from every quarter of the earth. The three sisters ate their fill, especially the Sun and the Wind, who were very greedy and left not so much as a crumb on their plates. But the Moon was kind and remembered her mother. She hid a part of her supper in her long white fingers to take home and share with her mother, the Star."],
        ["4", "\tThen the three sisters said good-bye to the Thunder and Lightning and went home."],
        ["5", "\tWhen they reached there, they found their mother, the Star, waiting and shining for them as she had said she would. “What did you bring me from the supper?” she asked."],
        ["6", "\tThe Sun tossed her head with all its yellow hair in disdain. “Why should I bring you anything?” she asked. “I went out for my own pleasure and not to think of you.” It was the same with the Wind. She wrapped her flowing robes about her and turned away from her mother. “I, too, went out for my own entertainment,” she said, “and why should I think of you, Mother, when you were not with me?” But it was very different with the Moon, who was not greedy and selfish as her two sisters were. She turned her pale sweet face toward her mother and held out her slender hands. “See, Mother,” cried the Moon, “I have brought you part of everything that was on my plate. I ate only half of the feast, for I wanted to share it with you.” So the mother brought a gold plate, and the food that her unselfish daughter, the Moon, had brought her heaped the plate high. She ate it, and then she turned to her three children, for she had something important to say to them."],
        ["7", "\tShe spoke first to the Sun. “You were selfish, my daughter,” she said. “You went out and enjoyed yourself with no thought of one who was left alone at home. Hereafter you shall be no longer beloved among men. Your rays shall be so hot and burning that they shall scorch everything they touch.” And that is why, to this day, the Sun is hot and blazing."],
        ["8", "\tNext the mother spoke to the Wind. “You, too, my daughter, have been unkind and greedy,” she said. “You enjoyed yourself with no thought of anyone else. You shall blow in the parching heat of your sister, the Sun, and wither and blast all that you touch.” And that is why, to this day, the Wind, blowing in hot weather, is so unpleasant."],
        ["9", "\tBut, last, the mother spoke to her kind daughter, the Moon. “You remembered your mother and were unselfish,” she said. “To those who are thoughtful of their mother, great blessings come. For all time your light shall be cool, calm, and beautiful. You shall wane, but you shall wax again. You shall make the dark night bright, and all men shall call you blessed.” And that is why, to this day, the Moon is so cool, bright, and beautiful."]
