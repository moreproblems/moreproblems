The median is the middle data value when the data values are sorted from least to greatest. Since there are 20 ages ordered, the median is the average of the two middle values, the 10th and 11th, which for these data are both 19. Therefore, the median is 19. The mean is the sum of the data values divided by the number of the data values. So for these data, the mean is ((18 × 6) + (19 × 5) + (20 × 4) + (21 × 2) + (22 × 1) + (23 × 1) + (30 × 1))/20 = 20.\nSince the mode is 18, the median is 19, and the mean is 20, mode < median < mean.\nAlternate approach: After determining the mode, 18, and the median, 19, it remains to determine whether the mean is less than 19 or more than 19. Because the mean is a balancing point, there is as much deviation below the mean as above the mean. It is possible to compare the data to 19 to determine the balance of deviation above and below the mean. There is a total deviation of only 6 below 19 (the 6 values of 18); however, the data value 30 alone deviates by 11 above 19. Thus the mean must be greater than 19.",

            "On April 18, 1775, Paul Revere set off on his midnight ride from Charlestown to Lexington.
