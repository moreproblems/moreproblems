Each player used a hard, plastic paddle to hit a puck across the table to a scoring area on the other player's side of the table. With the power turned off, the puck moved slowly. When the players turned the power on, air was blown upwards through tiny holes on the surface of the tabletop, allowing the puck to glide on the air. This caused the puck to move very rapidly when hit."]
