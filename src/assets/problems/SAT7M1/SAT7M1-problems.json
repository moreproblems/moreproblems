This expression consists of the initial number of bacteria, 40,000, multiplied by the expression 2ᵗ/⁷⁹⁰. The time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria to double is the increase in the value of t that causes the expression 2ᵗ/⁷⁹⁰ to double. Since the base is 2, the expression 2ᵗ/⁷⁹⁰ will double when the exponent increases by 1. Since the exponent of this expression is t/790, the exponent will increase by 1 when t increases by 790. Therefore, the time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria in the population to double is 790.\nAlternate approach: The initial number of bacteria in the population can be found by substituting 0 for t in the given function. This yields f(0) = 40,000(2)⁰/⁷⁹⁰, or f(0) = 40,000. Therefore, the initial number of bacteria present in the population is 40,000, so the bacteria population will have doubled when f(t) = 80,000. Substituting 80,000 for f(t) in the given function yields 80,000 = 40,000(2)ᵗ/⁷⁹⁰. Dividing both sides of this equation by 40,000 yields 2 = 2ᵗ/⁷⁹⁰, or 2¹ = 2ᵗ/⁷⁹⁰. It follows that 1 = t/790. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 790 yields 790 = t. Therefore, the time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria in the population to double is 790.",

The slope of a line can be found using two points on the line and the slope formula m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁). Each value of x and its corresponding value of y in the table can be represented by a point (x, y). Substituting the points (-s, 21) and (s, 15) for (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), respectively, in the slope formula yields m = (15 - 21)/(s - (-s)), which gives m = -6/(2s), or m = -3/s. Substituting -3/s for m and the point (s, 15) for (x₁, y₁) in the equation y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)yields y - 15 = -3(x - s)/s. Distributing -3/s on the right-hand side of this equation yields y - 15 = -3x/s + 3. Adding 15 to each side of this equation yields sy = -3x/s + 18.

The given equation, f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 15), can be rewritten as f(x) = x² + 13x - 30. By completing the square, this equation can be rewritten as f(x) = (x² + 13x + (13/2)²) - 30 - (13/2)², which is equivalent to f(x) = (x + 13/2)² - 289/4, or f(x) = (x - (-13/2))² - 289/4. Therefore, f(x) reaches its minimum when the value of x is -13/2.\nAlternate approach: The graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane is a parabola. The value of x for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it’s given that f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 15), it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane occur when x = 2 and x = -15, or at the points (2, 0) and (-15, 0). The midpoint between two points, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), is (((x₁ + x₂))/2, ((y₁ + y₂))/2). Therefore, the midpoint between (2, 0) and (-15, 0) is ((2 - 15)/2, (0 + 0)/2), or (-13/2, 0). It follows that f(x) reaches its minimum when the value of x is -13/2.",
