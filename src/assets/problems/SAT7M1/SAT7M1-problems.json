Subtracting the measure of ∠MPR from 180° yields the sum of the other angles in the triangle MPR. Since 180 − 120 = 60, the sum of the measures of ∠QMR and ∠NRM is 60°. It is given that MP = PR, so it follows that triangle MPR is isosceles. Therefore ∠QMR and ∠NRM must be congruent. Since the sum of the measure of these two angles is 60°, it follows that the measure of each angle is 30°.\nAn alternate approach would be to use the exterior angle theorem, noting that the measure of ∠QPR is equal to the sum of the measures of ∠QMR and ∠NRM.
