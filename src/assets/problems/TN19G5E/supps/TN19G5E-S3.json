        [" ", "\tMany people are drawn to pictures of baby animals. People like looking at pictures of all kinds of animals, [weather they are real] or imagined. Why is this? Scientists have different ideas about [it]. Some think that people like animal babies because of their likeness to human babies. Animal and human babies all have [big eyes, and high foreheads, and] small flat noses. Perhaps humans just like animal babies and want to care for them. This explanation does make sense. Others think that where we live influences us to like both human babies and baby animals. Do the same ideas influence people’s choice of pets?"],

In some places in Japan, prairie dogs are nowpopular as small, cute pets. Having this wild animal as a pet [have not been] allowed yet in the U.S."],
        [" ", "\tPeople do prefer cute animals. This much is true. “People today spend more time looking at cute things than ever [before noted] a writer in a popular newspaper. For whatever the reason, it is clear that humans will choose a picture of a kitten over one of an adult cat."]
