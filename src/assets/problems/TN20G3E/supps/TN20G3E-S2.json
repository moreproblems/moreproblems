        ["1", "\tWhen a snowman melts, it leaves us a gift that lasts all year. To find out what this gift is, let's take a closer look at what happens to the snowman."],
        ["2", "\tIt has to be warm outside for a snowman to melt. As the sun shines, it makes heat. We can't see heat, but we know it's there because we feel the warmth on our hands and faces."],
        ["3", "\tThe snowman gets smaller and smaller as it melts, until we can't see it at all. Where did it go?"],
        ["4", "\tAs the snowman melts, it turns into water. If you look carefully at snow, you'll see that it's actually small pieces of ice (called crystals) that are stuck together. When they get warm, the crystals change from ice into water."],
        ["5", "\tBut where does the water from the snowman go? The ground acts like a sponge and soaks up the water. As the water seeps into the ground, it finds lots of things that are thirsty. The water might find grass roots, flower bulbs, or tree roots."],
        ["6", "\tSo that's the snowman's year-round gift — water!"],
        ["7", "\tWithout water, we wouldn't have colorful flowers to look at in the spring. Without water, we wouldn't have soft, green grass to run barefoot on in the summer. Without water, we wouldn't have strong, tall trees to climb in the fall. Water helps all of these things grow. The snowman's gift lasts all year."]
