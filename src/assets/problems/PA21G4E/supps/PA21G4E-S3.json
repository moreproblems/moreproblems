        [" ", "\tCaldecott Medal-winning illustrator Ed Young doesn’t like to overemphasize the process of creativity . He says, “To me, it is the attitude behind everything that is more important than the procedure .”"],
        [" ", "\tA deeply thoughtful man, Ed Young believes that the creation of art involves much more than technical skill . Drawing and writing, he says, “are expressions of the inner rather than the outer person .”"],
        [" ", "\tIn practicing the art of calligraphy, Young learned to refine his brush strokes as well as to achieve a greater sensitivity to his craft . In calligraphy, as in life, Young believes that attitude is of prime importance . “A person has to know the nature of a brush, the nature of ink in the brush, the nature of ink applied by the brush onto paper . That person has to be friends with all of these in order to see what the brush is capable of doing ."],
        [" ", "\t“It is like training a horse . A person has to know what the nature of the horse is in order to ride it correctly . If the horse knows that the person understands him and gives him every possibility of exploring his potential, the horse will be very happy . And so with the brush .”"],
        ["", "Exᴘʟᴏʀɪɴɢ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴀ Pᴇɴᴄɪʟ"],
        [" ", "\tOnce he has selected a manuscript, Young immediately begins by making a series of sketches . The process is similar to an exploration; with each sketch, Young searches for the proper tone and image for the story . He says, “First I do little thumbnails right on the margin of the manuscript whenever there is a picture that comes to me . I just scribble, and the pictures that I draw are no more than maybe a half or three-quarters of an inch . It’s just a record of images that are in my head .”"],
        [" ", "\tIn what he calls rounds, Young revisits his initial sketches and expands upon them . Slowly, he adds more and more details, and the tiny pictures grow larger . Young explains, “They graduate, let’s say, from the first set of very small thumbnails to something two or three inches tall by five or six inches wide . At that point, I start to go into the characters or buildings or costumes, that kind of thing .”"],
        [" ", "\tDuring the next round, the element of research becomes very important . In the first sketches, Young only sought to capture a general impression, a feeling . Now he seeks painstaking accuracy . The pictures themselves seem to ask him these questions: In what style should the characters be dressed? What are the trees and flowers like in that part of the world? What is the style of architecture?"],
        [" ", "\tTo achieve this level of accuracy, Young turns to magazines, books, libraries, museums, or wherever he can find the information he needs . Young goes to all the trouble because he feels that factual detail helps create a believable fantasy . As an artist, he is preparing an imaginative world for the reader to visit . The trees, the flowers, the buildings—everything—must be true to that world ."],
        [" ", "\tAn example of Young’s emphasis on detail can be found in the work he did for Lon Po Po . The story, which is a Chinese version of “Little Red Riding Hood,” involves a wolf and children . (Lon Po Po means “Granny Wolf” in Chinese .) Ed Young explains how he made the wolf and children believable . “I drew a whole series on how wolves communicate with each other, using their ears, their tails, and the way they hold themselves . That had to be right because the wolf talks to the children in the story, so he has to be alive to them . Then I had to know how the children talked to each other, how they lived in the compound, how the trees would grow . Once you know everything about the story, you can express it in fresh ways .”"],
        [" ", "\tEd Young was born in China, grew up in Shanghai, and later moved to Hong Kong before eventually settling in the United States . Of his childhood, Young recalls: “Our summer nights were usually spent on the flat roof of the three-story house that my father designed . Against the background of crickets chirping in the starry night, my father would spin endless tales of his own to entertain our imagination until the heat finally subsided . I have never forgotten the images I saw in my mind as I listened .”"]
