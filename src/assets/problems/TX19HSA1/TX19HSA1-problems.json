The equation y = (–/4/9)x + 5 has a slope of –4/9; therefore the slope of a line perpendicular to it is 9/4. To determine the y-intercept (value where a line crosses the y-axis) of the perpendicular line, the student could have substituted 9/4 for the slope (m) and the point (36, 0) for the x-and y-values in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). This produces the equation 0 = (9/4)(36) + b. The student could have then multiplied 9/4 by 36, resulting in 0 = 81 + b. The student could have then subtracted 81 from both sides of the equation, resulting in –81 = b. Therefore the slope-intercept form of the equation of the perpendicular line is y = (9/4)x – 81.

Then the student could have found the factors (numbers or expressions that can be multiplied to get another number or expression) of 4x² + 12x – 135. The student could have identified two factors in the form, (Ax + B) and (Cx + D), for which A • C = 4,(A • D) + B C (B •C) = 12, and B • D = –135. The student could have identified the two factors as (2x – 9) and (2x + 15), because 2x • 2x = 4x², (2x • 15) + (–9 • 2x) = 12x, and –9 • 15 = –135. Then the student could have set the factor of 2x– 9 equal to 0 to determine the positive solution to the equation, resulting in 2x – 9 = 0. The student could have then added 9 to both sides of the equation, resulting in 2x = 9. Lastly the student could have divided both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in x = 9/2 = 4.5.

Next the student could have subtracted t from both sides of the first equation to solve for f, resulting in f = 18 – t. Using the substitution method, the student could have substituted f = 18 – t into the second equation, resulting in 3t + 4(18 – t) = 59. The student could have then distributed (multiplied) the 4 to the terms inside the parentheses, resulting in 3t +72 – 4t = 59. The student could have then combined the like terms (terms that contain the same variables raised to the same powers), resulting in 72 – t = 59. The student could have then subtracted 72 from both sides of the equation, resulting in –t = –13. Lastly, the student could have divided both sides of the equation by –1, resulting in t = 13. Therefore the number of courses completed worth 3 credits is 13. The rationale for the correct answer is an efficient way to solve the problem.

                    "Rationale": "To determine the equation of a line parallel (lines that do not intersect and are always the same distance from each other) to another line, the student could have first identified y = 1.2x + 3.8 as being in slope-intercept form (y = mx +b, where m represents the slope (steepness of a straight line when graphed on a coordinate grid; m = (y₂ – y₁)/(x₂ – x₁)) and b represents the y-intercept (value where a line crosses the y-axis)). Since parallel lines have the same slope, the student could have substituted the slope, 1.2, into the slope-intercept form, resulting in y = 1.2x + b. To determine the y-intercept, the student could have substituted the point (5, 0) for x and y in the slope-intercept form, resulting in 0 = 1.2(5) + b. The student could have then multiplied 1.2 by 5, resulting in 0 = 6 + b. To solve the equation for b, the student could have subtracted 6 from both sides of the equation, resulting in –6 = b. The equation y = 1.2x – 6 represents the line that passes through the point (5, 0) and is parallel to the line represented by y = 1.2x + 3.8. The rationale for the correct answer is an efficient way to solve the problem. However, other methods could be used to solve the problem correctly.",
