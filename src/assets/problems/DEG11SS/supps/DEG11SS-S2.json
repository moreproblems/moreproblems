It would eliminate injustices to women in employment, educational opportunities, and other areas.\n\n... One of our strongest reasons for supporting the equal rights amendment is that it would nullify all State restrictive laws that limit women as to what work they can do, how long they can work, and what they can lift.\n\nIt is an insult to women that such laws or rules are referred to as “protective” when their sole function is to exclude women from the higher-paying jobs.\n\nThe experience of the women employees at the plant where I am employed, demonstrates the urgent need for the equal rights amendment...\n\nThe women working [at my plant] were denied the right to work on the better-paying jobs to which their seniority entitled them, simply because they were women and the jobs might occasionally require the lifting of over 85 pounds...\n\nWe were kept off of higher paying easier jobs for years because the company wanted to “protect” us. I say it did not protect, but exploited women...\n\nTherefore, we ... support the equal rights amendment because it would have a restraining effect on those who abuse and discriminate against women. It would help to dispel the myth of women's inferiority."],

I recognize that the impetus for the passage of the equal rights amendment is the result of a growing anger amongst women over job discrimination, social and political discrimination, and many outmoded cultural habits of our way of life.\n\n... I do not believe, however, that passage of the equal rights amendment will satisfy, or is the solution to the problem...\n\n... Differences in laws are not necessarily discriminatory, nor should all laws containing different provisions for men and women be abolished, as the equal rights amendment would do...\n\n... I am sure you are aware of the influence of [minimum labor standards] legislation upon working conditions. And I am sure you are aware that many such laws apply to women only.\n\nThey are varied and they are in the field of minimum wages, hours of work, rest periods, weight lifting, childbirth legislation, et cetera.\n\nThese State laws ... should be amended where they are. They should be strengthened and they should be handled on a case-by-case basis...\n\nThe elimination of laws regulating hours women may work permits employers to force them to work excessive overtime, endangering not only their health and safety, but disrupting the entire family relationship...\n\nI oppose the equal rights amendment since the equality it may achieve may well be equality of mistreatment."],
