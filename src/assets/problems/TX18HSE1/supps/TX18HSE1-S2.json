(2) It doesn't appear to consist of much more than a few hotels and a peculiar, grassless golf course. (3) As bleak as this may sound, the city of Coober Pedy is actually quite fascinating. (4) There are even people who live here. (5) These people are under ground."],

(8) After all, miners from all over the world flooded into the region to seek their fortunes.
