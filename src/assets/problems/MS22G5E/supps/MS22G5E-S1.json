The moon's shadow on Earth isn't very big, so only a small portion of places on Earth will see it. You have to be on the sunny side of the planet when it happens. You also have to be in the path of the moon's shadow."],

It's true that the moon goes around Earth every month, but it doesn't always get in Earth's shadow. The moon's path around Earth is tilted compared to Earth's orbit around the sun. The moon can be behind Earth but still get hit by light from the sun."],
        ["10", "\tBecause they don't happen every month, a lunar eclipse is a special event. Unlike solar eclipses, lots of people get to see each lunar eclipse. If you live on the nighttime half of Earth when the eclipse happens, you'll be able to see it."],

        ["12", "\tIf you've looked at the moon over the course of a few weeks, you've probably noticed that it looks slightly different every day. The change in its shadow is based on where it is in its orbit. We call this cycle the phases of the moon, and it occurs roughly once a month. At least twice a year, however, something quite different happens. The moon passes through the shadow cast by the earth causing it to look extremely unusual for a short period of time. From the Earth, the moon will appear to darken and turn a deep red before eventually returning to normal. This is called a lunar eclipse."],
        ["13", "\tIf we were to look at what happens from space during a lunar eclipse, it would go something like this. First, the moon passes through what's called the penumbra, where the Sun'slight is only partially obscured. This results in only a slight darkening of the moon. As the moon continues along its path, however, it enters what's called the umbra, where all direct light from the Sun is blocked. But if the Sun is blocked, why does the moon turn red? When light from the Sun goes by the side of the Earth, it passes through a long and thick layer of Earth's atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths of sunlight, like blue, are scattered by the atmosphere, so by the time the light has finished its trip to themoon, more of the longer wavelengths, like red, are left over. On the Earth, the same thing happens at sunset as the ground you stand on gradually passes into night."],
        ["14", "\tAs the eclipse ends, the moon leaves the umbra, returns to its normal color, and then leaves the penumbra, brightening and resuming its original cycle. Overall, the whole process lasts only from a few minutes to a few hours, so you'll have to be quick if you want to see it. But, as long as you're willing to stay awake, you'll catch the moon as you won't see it too often."]
