        [" ", "\tGoldfish are one of the most common fish kept in a home aquarium. One thing these fish need is an appropriately sized environment. Goldfish produce a hormone, known as somatostatin, that can limit their growth and can keep them from outgrowing their tank. Somatostatin allows the fish to grow to an appropriate size so that the concentration of wastes produced by the fish do not reach harmful levels in the aquarium."]
