(6) Each day the penguins leave their burrows, and out to sea they head to spend the day swimming and feeding. (7) But in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a number of oil spills in the region threatened the very existence of these birds. (8) Experts tried to help, but they couldn’t get to all the birds fast enough. (9) Some penguins would try to groom themselves. (10) They swallowed the toxic oil and died. (11) Knits for Nature formulated a unique plan. (12) They asked volunteers to knit sweaters for the penguins to wear. (13) The sweaters would not only protect the birds from the oil but would also keep them warm while they waited for their turn to be cleaned."],

(16) Other people from around the world also expressed interest in making sweaters for the little penguins. (17) The Penguin Foundation, the group now in charge of Knits for Nature, soon had 40,000 sweaters on hand. (18) Some of the sweaters were used for little penguins at the Wildlife Clinic at Phillip Island Nature Parks in Australia. (19) Others were distributed to nearby wildlife centers. (20) The foundation also sold some of the tiny sweaters to raise funds for fairy penguin research and conservation."],
