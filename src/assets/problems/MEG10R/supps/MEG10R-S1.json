        ["1", "\tDexter knew that there was something dismal about this Northern spring, just as he knew there was something gorgeous about the fall. Fall made him clinch his hands and tremble and repeat idiotic sentences to himself, and make brisk abrupt gestures of command to imaginary audiences and armies. October filled him with hope which November raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at Sherry Island were ready grist to his mill. He became a golf champion and defeated Mr. T. A. Hedrick in a marvelous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly—sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. Again, stepping from a Pierce-Arrow automobile, like Mr. Mortimer Jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the Sherry Island Golf Club—or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft... Among those who watched him in open-mouthed wonder was Mr. Mortimer Jones."],
        ["2", "\tAnd one day it came to pass that Mr. Jones—himself and not his ghost—came up to Dexter with tears in his eyes and said that Dexter was the —— best caddy in the club, and wouldn't he decide not to quit if Mr. Jones made it worth his while, because every other —— caddy in the club lost one ball a hole for him—regularly——"],
        ["3", "\t“No, sir,” said Dexter decisively, “I don't want to caddy anymore.” Then, after a pause: “I'm too old.”"],
        ["4", "\t“You're not more than fourteen. Why the devil did you decide just this morning that you wanted to quit? You promised that next week you'd go over to the State tournament with me.”"],
        ["5", "\t“I decided I was too old.”"],
        ["6", "\tDexter handed in his “A Class” badge, collected what money was due him from the caddy master, and walked home to Black Bear Village."],
        ["7", "\t“The best —— caddy I ever saw,” shouted Mr. Mortimer Jones over a drink that afternoon. “Never lost a ball! Willing! Intelligent! Quiet! Honest! Grateful!”"],
        ["8", "\tThe little girl who had done this was eleven—beautifully ugly ... The spark, however, was perceptible. There was a general ungodliness in the way her lips twisted down at the corners when she smiled, and in the—Heaven help us!—in the almost passionate quality of her eyes. Vitality is born early in such women. It was utterly in evidence now, shining through her thin frame in a sort of glow."],
        ["9", "\tShe had come eagerly out on to the course at nine o'clock with a white linen nurse and five small new golf-clubs in a white canvas bag which the nurse was carrying. When Dexter first saw her she was standing by the caddy house, rather ill at ease and trying to conceal the fact by engaging her nurse in an obviously unnatural conversation graced by startling and irrelevant grimaces from herself."],
        ["10", "\t“Well, it's certainly a nice day, Hilda,” Dexter heard her say. She drew down the corners of her mouth, smiled, and glanced furtively around, her eyes in transit falling for an instant on Dexter."],
        ["11", "\tThen to the nurse:"],
        ["12", "\t“Well, I guess there aren't very many people out here this morning, are there?”"],
        ["13", "\tThe smile again—radiant, blatantly artificial—convincing."],
        ["14", "\t“I don't know what we're supposed to do now,” said the nurse, looking nowhere in particular."],
        ["15", "\t“Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it up.”"],
        ["16", "\tDexter stood perfectly still, his mouth slightly ajar. He knew that if he moved forward a step his stare would be in her line of vision—if he moved backward he would lose his full view of her face. For a moment he had not realized how young she was. Now he remembered having seen her several times the year before—in bloomers."],
        ["17", "\tSuddenly, involuntarily, he laughed, a short abrupt laugh—then, startled by himself, he turned and began to walk quickly away."],
        ["18", "\t“Boy!”"],
        ["19", "\tDexter stopped."],
        ["20", "\t“Boy——”"],
        ["21", "\tBeyond question he was addressed. Not only that, but he was treated to that absurd smile, that preposterous smile—the memory of which at least a dozen men were to carry into middle age."],
        ["22", "\t“Boy, do you know where the golf teacher is?”"],
        ["23", "\t“He's giving a lesson.”"],
        ["24", "\t“Well, do you know where the caddy-master is?”"],
        ["25", "\t“He isn't here yet this morning.”"],
        ["26", "\t“Oh.” For a moment this baffled her. She stood alternately on her right and left foot."],
        ["27", "\t“We'd like to get a caddy,” said the nurse. “Mrs. Mortimer Jones sent us out to play golf, and we don't know how without we get a caddy.”"],
        ["28", "\tHere she was stopped by an o͟m͟i͟n͟o͟u͟s glance from Miss Jones, followed immediately by the smile."],
        ["29", "\t“There aren't any caddies here except me,” said Dexter to the nurse, “and I got to stay here in charge until the caddy-master gets here.”"],
        ["30", "\t“Oh.”"],
        ["31", "\tMiss Jones and her retinue now withdrew, and at a proper distance from Dexter became involved in a heated conversation, which was concluded by Miss Jones taking one of the clubs and hitting it on the ground with violence. For further emphasis she raised it again and was about to bring it down smartly upon the nurse's bosom, when the nurse seized the club and twisted it from her hands."],
        ["32", "\t“You ... little mean old thing!” cried Miss Jones wildly."],
        ["33", "\tAnother argument ensued. Realizing that the elements of the comedy were implied in the scene, Dexter several times began to laugh, but each time restrained the laugh before it reached audibility ..."],
        ["34", "\tThe situation was resolved by the fortuitous appearance of the caddy-master, who was appealed to immediately by the nurse."],
        ["35", "\t“Miss Jones is to have a little caddy, and this one says he can't go.”"],
        ["36", "\t“Mr. McKenna said I was to wait here till you came,” said Dexter quickly."],
        ["37", "\t“Well, he's here now.” Miss Jones smiled cheerfully at the caddy-master. Then she dropped her bag and set off at a haughty mince toward the first tee."],
        ["38", "\t“Well?” The caddy-master turned to Dexter. “What you standing there ... ? Go pick up the young lady's clubs.”"],
        ["39", "\t“I don't think I'll go out today,” said Dexter."],
        ["40", "\t“You don't——”"],
        ["41", "\t“I think I'll quit.”"],
        ["42", "\tThe enormity of his decision frightened him. He was a favorite caddy, and the thirty dollars a month he earned through the summer were not to be made elsewhere around the lake. But he had received a strong emotional shock, and his perturbation required a violent and immediate outlet."],
        ["43", "\tIt is not so simple as that, either. As so frequently would be the case in the future, Dexter was unconsciously dictated to by his winter dreams."]
