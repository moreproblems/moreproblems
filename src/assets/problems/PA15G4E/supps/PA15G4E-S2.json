        [" ", "\tAs you go on your first hike, don’t rush. Walk at a leisurely pace. You’ll soon fall into a comfortable stride. This first hike might be just to observe. Take in the sights, sounds, and smells of the area. What do you see? At each place you hike, you will see different things. Watch for bird nests, snake skins, feathers, nursery logs, mushrooms, fish, animal tracks. Soon you’ll realize that much of the fun of hiking is in studying nature and much of the fun of studying nature is in the detective work. Who made these tracks? What kind of bird dropped this feather? Every good detective takes notes."],
        [" ", "\tHow about making a hiking journal for your trek? You can include notes on the date of the hike, weather conditions, where you are going, and a diagram of the landscape. Sketch the animal tracks you see along the creek, add a feather you found, draw the tadpole you saw in the big puddle. Maybe later you can find out how long it will be before the tadpole becomes a frog. You can also add photographs from your hike—like the chipmunk that chattered at you while you ate lunch, and your family members when they jumped into the creek."],
