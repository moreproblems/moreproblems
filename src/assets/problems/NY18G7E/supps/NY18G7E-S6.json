        "Kia, a Hmong girl from Laos, has just moved to Minnesota with her family. Hmong are a group of people from the mountain regions of Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and southern China. Because Minnesota is so different from Laos, the family relies on their friend Thek to teach them about their new home."

        ["5", "so many people with hair the color of wheat and skin nearly as pale as cauliflower. And it"],
        [" ", "seemed, in this land of so much, there was no silence to be found. Each night Grandfather"],

        [" ", "ready to cook; chickens that had been cleaned and cut up. So much food for so little work,"],

        [" ", "\tIn the evenings, Grandfather pulled a chair to the window and gazed at the buildings"],
        [" ", "that shut out the sky. Kia guessed he was remembering how important it was in Laos to be"],
        [" ", "able to see a mountain from each house. Here, all he could see were whizzing cars on the"],
        [" ", "black asphalt. In Laos, before a house was built, a hole was dug, and as many grains of rice"],
        ["25", "as there were family members were placed in the hole. If the spirits moved the grain"],

        [" ", "be washed to the laundry room in the basement of the building. It was a dingy room with"],

        ["45", "\tBlushing, Kia began pulling the soiled clothes from the machine and piling them into"],

        [" ", "\t“Here. Just leave them clothes there. I've got a cupful of quarters. You can borrow"],
