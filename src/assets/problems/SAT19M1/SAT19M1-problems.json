Therefore, the slope of the graph of the function g is the negative reciprocal of −2, which is (−1)/(−2) = 1/2, and an equa tion that defines the function g is g(x) = (1/2)x + b, where b is a constant. Since it's given that the graph of the function g passes through the point (1, 3), the value of b can be found using the equation 3 = (1/2)(1) + b . Solving this equation for b yields b = 5/2, so an equation that defines the function g is g(x) = 1/2 x + 5/2.
