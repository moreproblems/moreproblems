Subtracting t from both sides of the equation gives 2x² − 4x − t = 0. In this form, a = 2, b = −4, and c = −t. The values of t for which the equation has no real solutions are the same values of t for which the discriminant of this equation is a negative value. The discriminant is equal to (−4)² − 4(2)(−t); therefore, (−4)² − 4(2)(−t) < 0. Simplifying the left side of the inequality gives 16 + 8t < 0.

Since triangle BCD and triangle ACE are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. So in triangle BCD and triangle ACE, BD corresponds to AE and CD corresponds to CE. Therefore, BD/CD = AE/CE. Since triangle BCD is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to give the value of CD: 6² + 8² = CD². Taking the square root of each side gives CD = 10. Substituting the values in the proportion BD/CD = AE/CE yields 67/10 = 18/CE. Multiplying each side by CE, and then multiplying by 10/6 yields CE = 30. Therefore, the length of CE is 30.",
