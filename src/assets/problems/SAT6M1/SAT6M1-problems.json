Triangle BCD and triangle ACE are similar because if two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar. Since triangle BCD and triangle ACE are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. So in triangle BCD and triangle ACE, BD corresponds to AE and CD corresponds to CE. Therefore, BD/CD = AE/CE. Since triangle BCD is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to give the value of CD: 6² + 8² = CD². Taking the square root of each side gives CD = 10. Substituting the values in the proportion BD/CD = AE/CE yields 67/10 = 18/CE. Multiplying each side by CE, and then multiplying by 10/6 yields CE = 30. Therefore, the length of CE is 30.",
