        ["1", "\tA honey bee returns to the hive. Sticky pollen clings to her body. Nectar fills her honey sac. She’s found apple blossoms in a distant orchard. How does she tell other worker bees about this new food source? She dances!"],
        ["2", "\tUnlike humans, animals don’t have words to help them communicate. They can’t say “Hey! Look what I found,” or “Keep away! This is my spot,” or “Want to go steady?” Yet, animals communicate all the time. They send out signals — messages others receive and understand using their senses of smell, taste, touch, hearing, and sight."],
        ["3", "\tAnimals with good vision “talk” to each other with their bodies. They use patterns of movements to share information, to defend themselves or their territories, and to attract mates. Nature designs their steps, and they dance as if their lives depended on it. Often, they do."],
        ["", "Language of Bees"],
        ["4", "\tMost communication takes place among members of the same species. In dark beehives, honeycombed walls become waxy dance floors. Like a rock star swarmed by adoring fans, a bee returning from the apple orchard begins her dance. Other workers follow her as she moves forward in a straight line. She vibrates her wings and wags her body side to side very quickly — 13 to 15 times a second. Then she turns to one side, circles back, and begins the waggle run again. When she finishes, she circles around — this time in the opposite direction — and repeats her steps. The dance may go on for hours."],
        ["", "problems/TN19G4E/media/S2a.jpg"],
        ["5", "\tAs she traces a figure 8 on the dance floor, the follower bees touch her with their antennae. They sense the odors of apple blossom nectar and pollen clinging to her body. These workers also detect the scent she used to mark the distant flowers. A flight plan is coded in her movements. The length of the waggle run tells workers how far the flowers are from the hive. Its angle tells them how to get there. Because bees steer by the sun, the dancer links her directions to its position in the sky."],
        ["6", "\tHowever, the position of the sun in the sky keeps changing. If the waggle dance lasts for hours, how do bees leaving the hive long after the dance has begun find their targets? Amazingly, they do. The waggling bee adjusts her dance to account for the sun’s movement."],
        ["", "KEEP AWAY! This is my spot!"],
        ["7", "\tNot all animals cooperate the way honey bees do. Most compete for food,territory, and mates. Fights take time and energy. Rivals risk injury and death, weakening the group as a whole. So some animals dance instead, using movements to make themselves look larger, stronger, and quicker than their competition. “Don’t mess with me,” they say."],
        ["", "Red Fish, Blue Fish"],
        ["8", "\tMost fish settle conflicts over territory without fighting. But Siamese fighting fish, also known as bettas, are little fish with a big mean streak. Brightly colored bettas in pet stores have been specially bred for their beautiful veil-like fins. In the wild, they live in rice paddies in southeast Asia."],
        ["", "problems/TN19G4E/media/S2b.jpg"],
        ["9", "\tIf threatened, male Siamese fighting fish switch back and forth between face-to-face and side-to-side positions. Facing each other, they flare out flaps of skin on their necks and extend their fins. This makes them seem twice their size. Side-to-side, they flicker their fins and beat the water with their tails. Tail beating gets faster and faster until one male backs down. The loser lowers his fins and puts his tail down. His bright red, blue, or purple body color fades to a dull hue. Defeated, he swims away."],
        ["", "Lizard Lingo"],
        ["10", "\tLizards sport a wide variety of odd body parts: scaly crests on their tails, necks, and backs; spines, knobs, and horns on their heads; and fleshy dewlaps — flaps of skin under their necks that flare out like fans, then disappear. When males compete for territory or challenge each other to see who is “the best,” these weird ornaments come in handy."],
        ["", "problems/TN19G4E/media/S2c.jpg"],
        ["11", "\tGreen anoles are small lizards found in the southeastern United States. They cling to rocks, trees, walls, and screens. At times, it looks as if they’re listening to hip-hop music on invisible head-sets. Their bodies groove to the beat. Their heads bob as their legs push up and down."],
        ["12", "\tWhen two male anoles meet, they really get going. To appear bigger and scarier, they raise a scaly ridge or crest along their backs and develop dark spots behind their eye sockets. They turn to the side to present the broadest part of their bodies to each other. The dance ends when one backs down. The loser bobs his head slowly as if to say “you the man,” then moves away."],
        ["", "Spectacular Spiders"],
        ["13", "\tWith their eight legs, wolf spiders have a hairy “chorus line” attached to their bodies. When males meet, they challenge each other. They move back and forth, raising their brush-covered forelegs, and waving their palps, jawlike feelers. One spider lunges; the other backs away. If they’re evenly matched, they may switch roles and the fleeing male becomes the chaser. As they run, retreat, approach, wave their abdomens, make contact, and tap each other, their dance looks like a cross between a cha-cha and a boxing match."],
