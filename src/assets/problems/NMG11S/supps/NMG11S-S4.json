The student observes that even though the car was moving slowly, the rear bumper of the car was damaged. She wonders why the bumper was damaged by a low-speed collision. She decides to investigate."],
        [" ", "The student is surprised to learn that cars are designed to be damaged during collisions. When cars were first built, they were designed to be undamaged by collisions. However, people soon realized that when cars were not damaged during collisions, the people inside them were. So cars were redesigned to increase damage to the car in order to decrease damage to the people inside the car."],
        [" ", "To understand this, the student learns that cars are designed with crumple zones at the front and rear ends of the car that reduce the force on a car during a collision. The diagram shows how a collision can affect the crumple zones at the ends of a car."],

She finds data from a scientific study in which researchers measured the speed of a car during a collision that stopped the car. The researchers used cars with four different initial speeds in their study. The graph shows the initial speed of each car and how the speed of the car changed during the collision with the wall."],
