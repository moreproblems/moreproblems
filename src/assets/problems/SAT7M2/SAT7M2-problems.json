Therefore a column of stacked one-cent coins that is 4 inches tall would contain slightly more than 50 one-cent coins. It can then be reasoned that because 8 inches is twice 4 inches, a column of stacked one-cent coins that is 8 inches tall would contain slightly more than twice as many coins; that is, slightly more than 100 one-cent coins. An alternate approach is to set up a proportion comparing the column height to the number of one-cent coins, or (3 7/8 inches)/(50 coins) = (8 inches)/(x coins), where x is the number of coins in an 8-inch-tall column. Multiplying each side of the proportion by 50x gives (3 7/8)x = 400. Solving for x gives x = (400 × 8)/31, which is approximately 103.

Since BC = 15, which is 3 times as long as the hypotenuse of the 3-4-5 triangle, the similarity ratio of △ABC to the 3-4-5 triangle is 3:1. Therefore, the length of AC (the side opposite to B) is 3 × 3 = 9, and the length of AB (the side adjacent to angle B) is 4 × 3 = 12. It is also given that DA = 4. Since AB = DA + DB and AB = 12, it follows that DB = 8, which means that the similarity ratio of △DBE to the 3-4-5 triangle is 2:1 (DB is the side adjacent to angle B).

Similarly, the table shows 3 contestants each answered 4 questions correctly, so those 3 contestants scored 12 points in total (3 × 4 = 12). Continuing these calculations reveals that the 4 contestants who answered 3 questions correctly scored 12 points in total (4 × 3 = 12); the 6 contestants who answered 2 questions correctly scored 12 points in total (6 × 2 = 12); the 2 contestants who answered 1 question correctly scored 2 points in total (2 × 1 = 2); and the 3 contestants who answered 0 questions correctly scored 0 points in total (3 × 0 = 0). Adding up the total of points scored by these 20 contestants gives 10 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 2 + 0 = 48. Therefore, the mean score of the contestants is 48/20 = 2.4.",
