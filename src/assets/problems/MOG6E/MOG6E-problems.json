It is the engineer’s job to make sure the roof is strong enough to support the weight of the garden. Then an architect is hired to design the garden. Only then can construction begin. Rooftop gardens have multiple layers. Each one serves a different purpose, such as irrigating, or watering, the plants and preventing soil runoff.",
