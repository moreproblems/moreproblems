It is the engineer’s job to make sure the roof is strong enough to support the weight of the garden. Then an architect is hired to design the garden. Only then can construction begin. Rooftop gardens have multiple layers. Each one serves a different purpose, such as irrigating, or watering, the plants and preventing soil runoff.",

Cities such as New York rely on multistory apartment buildings to house their dense populations. To attract new buyers, developers are using rooftop gardens to improve the appeal of the buildings. The gardens provide a place to escape from the concrete jungle of the city, even for a short time. They are an area for socialization, encouraging people to connect with their neighbors.",
