        [" ", "For centuries, walls were the main support of a building. The taller the building, the thicker the walls had to be. In the late 1800s a 16-story building in Chicago had walls 6 feet thick. Around that time, though, people figured out how to mass-produce steel. Steel is made from iron and a tiny amount of carbon. Stronger than pure iron, steel made it possible to build taller, stronger buildings—the buildings we call skyscrapers. A skeleton made of steel supported the walls. The walls could hang from the steel skeleton almost like curtains."],

        [" ", "Steel made taller buildings possible, but the elevator made them practical. Can you imagine walking up a hundred flights of stairs to your apartment? In 1852, Elisha Otis invented an elevator with a safety brake. The brake kept it from falling if the cables failed. His invention made it possible for people to move up and down tall buildings quickly and safely."],

        [" ", "Sure, you can get around in a city without subways, but it isn’t always easy! As cities grew more crowded, streets filled with traffic. Subways make it possible to move around quickly. They help reduce traffic and keep transportation moving even in bad weather."],
