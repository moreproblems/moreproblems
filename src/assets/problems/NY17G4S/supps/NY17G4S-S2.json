        [" ", "\tOne hundred years ago, there were 100,000 tigers living in the wild. Today, there are only about 3,000. Humans have caused the decrease in the tiger population. Some people eat the same foods that tigers eat, so tigers have to compete with people for food like deer and wild pigs. Also, people have destroyed much of the tigers' habitat by cutting down forests and constructing buildings and houses."],
        [" ", "\tSome people have created tiger preserves, which are areas where tigers can live safely. Others are working on saving the forests and the prey that tigers depend on to live."]
