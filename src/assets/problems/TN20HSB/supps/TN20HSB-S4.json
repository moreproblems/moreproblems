        [" ", "In white clover plants, two different genes determine the ability to produce cyanide. Gene A determines whether the plant produces precursor molecules from which cyanide is produced. Cyanide precursors are stored in vacuoles in the cytoplasm of clover plant cells. Gene L determines whether the plant has the enzyme linamarase, which releases cyanide from precursor molecules. Linamarase is stored between the plasma membrane and the cell wall of clover plant cells. Plants must have dominant alleles of both genes (A and L) to produce cyanide."],
        [" ", "When clover cells are damaged, cyanide precursors are released from the cytoplasm and come into contact with the linamarase outside of the cell membrane. This interaction results in the production of cyanide."]
