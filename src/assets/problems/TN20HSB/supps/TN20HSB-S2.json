        [" ", "The algae Vaucheria litorea are able to carry out photosynthesis; however, isolated chloroplasts from V. litorea are not. Researchers have determined that the DNA within the chloroplasts contains the genes required for photosynthesis. Many of the additional genes needed to sustain chloroplast function are located in the nucleus. To investigate the genetic requirements for chloroplast function in the green sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, researchers sequenced the psbO gene found in V. litorea. The psbO gene encodes for part of the water-splitting complex in the light-dependent reaction during photosynthesis. The researchers then determined which cells, cell parts, and developmental stage of the green sea slug, if any, also contain this gene. The data from their investigation are shown in the table."],
