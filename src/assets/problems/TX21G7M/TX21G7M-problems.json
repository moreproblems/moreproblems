Similarly, proportions to find the predicted number of visitors who prefer hiking trails, x; the number of visitors who prefer water sports, y; and the number of visitors who prefer biking trails, z, are 22/80 = x/200, 14/80 = y/200, and 16/80 = z/200.

To find the rate of change, the student could have used the points (−2, 7) and (1, 1) and found the ratio of the vertical distance (up and down) to the horizontal distance (left to right). The vertical distance between these two points is 6 units, and the horizontal distance between these two points is 3 units. Since the line is decreasing from left to right, the rate of change is negative. This results in a rate of change of −6/3 = −2. The y-value is 3 when x = 0.Substituting −2 for m and 3 for b in the equation y = mx + b results in the equation y = −2x + 3.

For each semicircle, the diameter (straight line going through the center of a circle connecting two points on the circle) is 3 centimeters. As a result, the radius (distance from the center of the circle to a point on the circle) of each semicircle is 1.5 centimeters, or half the length of the diameter. The student could have used the formulas for the areas of a triangle, rectangle, and circle from the Area section of the STAAR Grade 7 Mathematics Reference Materials page within the student’s test booklet (triangle: A = 1/2 • bh, where A = area of the triangle, b = the base, and h = the height; rectangle: A = bh, where A = area of the rectangle, b = the base, and h = the height; and circle: A = πr², where A = area of the circle, π = pi (approximately 3.14), and r = radius).

The student should have then recognized that the number of hours is represented by x, so 42 times the number of hours can be represented by 42x. The student should have then recognized that the total number of letters Natasha puts in envelopes, represented by y, is equal to 42 times the number of hours. Therefore, the equation is y = 42x."
