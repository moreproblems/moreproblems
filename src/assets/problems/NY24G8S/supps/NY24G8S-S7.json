Rock strata in the Death Valley region can provide evidence for the geologic history of the area. The oldest rocks are metamorphic and are approximately 1.7 billion years old. Sedimentary rocks in the valley region are about 500 million years old and are evidence that the area was the site of a warm shallow sea. Igneous rock layers are believed to range from 65.5 to about 2 million years old when volcanic ash and cinder from nearby volcanoes covered the region."],
