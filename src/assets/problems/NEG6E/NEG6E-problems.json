[4] During the 1800s, it was a landmark along the Oregon Trail and the California Trail and the Mormon Trail. [5] It has had several names like Chimley Rock and Elk's Peak before being named Chimney Rock. [6] The Lakota Sioux, a Native American tribe, knew of this landmark well before pioneers came to Nebraska. [7] There is the Ethel and Christopher J.
