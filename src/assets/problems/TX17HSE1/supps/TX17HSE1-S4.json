(2) In this environment it can be hard to stand out, especially if your relatively new. (3) I just moved to this school last year, so chances are pretty good that you don't know who I am. (4) But today I would like to introduce myself. (5) It's almost time to vote for next year's class officers, and I want to tell you why I would make a great president for our sophomore class."],

(7) He or she has to be in touch with the needs of 400 other people, all of whom are involved in different activities and have widely varied interests. (8) A class president must be in a position to hear many different opinions. (9) As a freshman last year, I played on the school baseball team, sang in the school choir, served as the Spanish Club historian, volunteered at the annual canned food drive, and earned recognition in the National Honor Society. (10) As you can see, I interact with a wide variety of people, so it will be easy for me to represent the diversity in our class."],
