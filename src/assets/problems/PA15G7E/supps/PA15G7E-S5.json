        [" ", "\tThe school bake sale, where moms would whip up Bundt cakes and magic bars as a badge to their culinary skills and commitment to their kids, is as retro as a tuna casserole. Announce to a roomful of moms at back-to-school night that there will be a bake sale fund-raiser, and you can hear the collective groan. The pressure to whip up a homemade dessert can put overstressed working moms over the top. It’s time to cut moms some slack. Slice and bake cookies taste just fine and repurposing a store-bought carton of cupcakes is no crime."],
        [" ", "\tBut it may be time to toss out the bake sale fund-raiser not because today’s moms don’t know how to bake or never mastered home economics, but because America’s kids don’t need to eat any more sweets. We’re an over-stuffed nation of over-snacked kids. Raising funds from blondies and brownies rarely moves the needle for the P.T.A. budget, but it does tip the scale for our kids."],
        [" ", "\tMaybe a farm-to-table fund-raiser is more socially correct. Co-op organic gardens could be the new trend with schools planting their gardens and selling the produce to the community. Is this labor intensive? Absolutely. But it’s also hands-on learning. Teaching kids how to grow arugula and make salad makes more sense and is surprisingly more satisfying than baking cookies—just ask Michelle Obama. And if that doesn’t help bring in the much needed school funds, writing a check to the P.T.A. is always a good option."]
