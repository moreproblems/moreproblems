            ":ibox:[1] My family has decided to take a Nebraska state vacation this summer. [2] Our first stop is going to be the Homestead National Monument of America, which honors passage of the Homestead Act of 1862. [3] There is about 100 acres of tallgrass prairie there, too; it looks just like it did before pioneers settled Nebraska. [4] Also there is an original homesteader cabin, called the Palmer-Epard Cabin, built in 1867. [5] There is also, from 1872 to 1967, the Freeman School that was the longest continuously used school in Nebraska state history, and it was a one-room school, too. [6] All of this is great, but what my sister and I are looking forward to is walking on all of the trails at the monument. [7] We are looking at the online National Park Service map and will convince our parents to park at the Homestead Heritage Center in the bottom corner. [8] That way we can walk all of the trails in a big loop.",

First, girls who participate in sports report having fewer problems with depression and have higher self-esteem than those who don't participate. Perhaps this partly accounts for why female athletes graduate at a higher rate, 69 percent, compared to 51 percent for girls who are not in sports. The outlook for even more young women participating in sports seems likely, especially since a survey of parents found that 83 percent believe that girls' athletic programs are as important as boys' programs.",

First named by researchers in 1952, this area of the United States is morelikely to experience tornadoes than any other place in the country (except Florida, which has over 60 tornadoes per year). Tornado Alley is prime territory for tornadoes because of itsgeographic location. Each year, hundreds of supercell thunderstorms form over this region, which is between two mountain ranges and the Gulf Coast. Despite the large number of occurrences each year, only a small number of tornadoes cause significant damage. When a tornado is reported, the National Weather Service assigns it a rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale based on different characteristics of the storm (wind speed, size, damage caused, etc.). Americans who live in Tornado Alley need to be prepared for any size of tornado, simply because of where they live.",

Grinding wheat, corn, and buckwheat, the mill began operation on August 29, 1874, when W. C. Gallaway finished construction. Its turbines were improved so it could supply electricity until 1925.
