        ["2", "Juliet\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,\nSo stumblest on my counsel?"],
        ["3", "Romeo\nBy a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word."],
        ["4", "Juliet\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound;\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?"],
        ["5", "Romeo\nNeither, fair saint, if either thee dislike."],
        ["6", "Juliet\nHow cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb;\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here."],
        ["7", "Romeo\nWith love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out:\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt;\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me."],
        ["8", "Juliet\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee."],
        ["9", "Romeo\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,\nAnd I am proof against their enmity."],
        ["10", "Juliet\nI would not for the world they saw thee here."],
        ["11", "Romeo\nI have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\nAnd, but thou love me, let them find me here.\nMy life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love."],
        ["12", "Juliet\nBy whose direction found'st thou out this place?"],
        ["13", "Romeo\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,\nI would adventure for such merchandise."],
        ["14", "Juliet\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me, I know thou wilt say Ay;\nAnd I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo: but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,\nMy true-love passion: therefore pardon me;\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered."],
        ["15", "Romeo\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops, — "],
        ["16", "Juliet\nO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable."],
        ["17", "Romeo\nWhat shall I swear by?"],
        ["18", "Juliet\nDo not swear at all;\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee."],
        ["19", "Romeo\nIf my heart's dear love, — "],
        ["20", "Juliet\nWell, do not swear: although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night;\nIt is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! as sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!"]
