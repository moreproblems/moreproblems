        [" ", "The Atlantic menhaden fish is found along the east coast from Canada to Florida. Some scientists consider menhaden “the most important fish in the ocean” because it is the little fish that is eaten by sea birds and bigger fish such as bass, bluefish, tuna, and even dolphins and whales. It is considered a keystone species, a fish that many other fish in the ocean ecosystem depend on for a healthy ocean. If there are not enough menhaden, many other species of fish will starve and populations will decrease, threatening the ocean ecosystem."],
        [" ", "For this reason, 15 states, including New York, have agreed to a plan to manage and maintain menhaden populations based on the needs of the fish that feed on them. Around Long Island, scientists, commercial fishermen, recreational boaters, and even bird watchers have all agreed to monitor and limit how many menhaden can be caught by humans. Menhaden that are caught are processed in fish factories for fertilizer, chicken feed, and fish oil."],
