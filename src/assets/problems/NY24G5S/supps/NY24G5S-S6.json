If she sees a threat, she will whistle to alert other meerkats in the group. Meerkats are social mammals, living in groups of up to 40 individuals. These groups are called mobs. The whole mob helps raise the pups by guarding and feeding them."],

In order to escape daytime heat and to keep warm on cold nights, meerkats dig burrows. They eat many things, including insects, small animals (rodents), lizards, roots and fruits. Meerkats get all the water they need from the food they eat â€” they never drink water."],
