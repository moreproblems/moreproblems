        [" ", "\tSome people celebrate the lunar new year, but do you know what that is? [It might be helpful to first consider the Western calendar which is also called the Gregorian calendar.] It is used all over the world, [accept] in countries that follow religious calendars. The Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. The dates on the solar calendar are based on the Earth's position in relation to the Sun. So the Earth [was] in the same position relative to the Sun on the same day every year."],
        [" ", "\tIn contrast, the lunar calendar bases its months on the lunar cycle — the time from one full moon to the next. The length of lunar months varies from 29 to 30 days, but twelve lunar cycles add up to 354 days instead of 365. This is why the lunar new year, or Chinese New Year, is on a different date each year."],
        [" ", "\tAlthough the lunar new year has been honored in Asia for centuries, in recent years other countries have observed it as well. [One reason for this new interest; globalization.] As people move around the globe, [they get shown around other cultures] and share in their celebrations. Whatever the reason, every new year is a cause for celebration."]
