Substituting 0 for f(x) in the function equation yields 0 = x² + 5x + 4. Factoring the right-hand side of 0 = x² + 5x + 4 yields 0 = (x + 4)(x + 1). If 0 = (x + 4)(x + 1), then 0 = x + 4 or 0 = x + 1. Solving both of these equations for x yields x = −4 and x = −1. Therefore, the x-intercepts of the graph of f(x) = x² + 5x + 4 are (−4, 0) and (−1, 0). Since both points lie on the x-axis, the distance between (−4, 0) and (−1, 0) is equivalent to the number of unit spaces between −4 and −1 on the x-axis, which is 3.",

Applying the distributive property on the right-hand side of the equation 4x = (x − 3)(x − 3) yields 4x = x² − 3x − 3x + 9. Subtracting 4x from both sides of 4x = x² − 3x − 3x + 9 yields 0 = x² − 3x − 3x − 4x + 9, which can be rewritten as 0 = x² − 10x + 9. Factoring the right-hand side of 0 = x² − 10x + 9 gives 0 = (x − 1)(x − 9). By the zero product property, if 0 = (x − 1)(x − 9), then 0 = x − 1 or 0 = x − 9. Adding 1 to both sides of 0 = x − 1 gives x = 1. Adding 9 to both sides of 0 = x − 9 gives x = 9. Substituting these values for x into the given equation will determine whether they satisfy the equation. Substituting 1 for x in the given equation yields √(4(1)) = 1 − 3, or √4 = −2, which is false. Therefore, x = 1 doesn't satisfy the given equation.

This yields y = 3x + 6 and y = (−a/2)x + 2 . The slope and y-intercept of the line with equation −3x + y = 6 are 3 and (0, 6), respectively. The slope and y-intercept of the line with equation ax + 2y = 4 are represented by the expression −a/2 and the point (0, 2), respectively. The value of a can be found by setting the two slopes equal to each other, which gives −a/2 = 3 . Multiplying both sides of this equation by −2 gives a = −6.
