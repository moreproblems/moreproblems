        [" ", "Sleeping in a tree can help to keep an animal safe. High up in the treetop, many animals are able to keep a distance from their enemies. It is not surprising that many birds choose to sleep in trees. Some hide in holes. Others find a branch to rest on."],
        [" ", "Other animals sleep in trees too. Many chimpanzees build nests out of branches and vines in the trees. Each night a chimpanzee will build itself a new nest. Some kinds of squirrels also sleep in trees. Their nests are often made of leaves."],

        [" ", "Some birds that live in or near water will sleep standing in the water. It is believed that sleeping on their feet allows these birds to take off quickly if they are in any danger. When birds sleep with only their feet in the water, it may help them to look like sticks in the water. This tricks predators into thinking they are sticks and not something the predators would like to eat."],
        [" ", "Fishes sleep in many different ways. Some rest on the lake or sea bottom, and some bury themselves in the sand or mud. This way of sleeping also works as a disguise. It can help fishes to hide from their enemies. Fishes sleep with their eyes open because they have no eyelids."],
