        ["", ":box:Lynne Cox is a famed open water swimmer and author of the best-selling book Swimming to Antarctica (2004)—a chronicle of her swims across the Bering Strait, the English Channel (twice), and one mile to the shores of Antarctica.\n\nHer book Grayson (2006) is the remarkable story of her experience swimming with a lost gray whale off the coast of California when she was just 17 years old. We spoke with Lynne to get her thoughts on that amazing experience."],

The youngest reader I met was four years old. The oldest is 97. It's really cool. I met a librarian from Carlsbad, California, and she and her husband would take turns reading a page at a time at night. You write a book and you never think about the way that story will be shared.

It's a combination of telling the story and making it more real by including details. So I went back and did research on everything to make sure it was accurate. Things like, do gray whales have four or five dimples on their back? I couldn't remember. I had to find that out. Or how big the mother whale gets and whether the female is bigger than the male.

It's hard for me to swim in a pool."],

Physical training prepares you mentally. During the swim with Grayson I was scared and wanted to get out of the water, but I kept talking to myself and telling myself to remain calm—to remind myself to swim closer to shore.
