        [" ", "In the winter, seawater evaporates and precipitates as snow on top of sea ice. The snow freezes and the sea ice becomes thicker. When the water evaporates from the sea, it leaves behind saltier water because the salt does not evaporate. As a result, icebergs and sea ice are freshwater bodies. Sea ice has an albedo of about 60%. Therefore, sea ice reflects about 60% of the sun’s radiation and absorbs about 40%. In the summer, the ice begins to crack and pieces of it fall into the ocean. When a piece of sea ice falls into the sea, it melts. Since the sea ice is freshwater, it results in a concentration of freshwater on the surface of the ocean near the sea ice."],
        [" ", "The students want to investigate how the cycle of sea ice formation helps make ocean currents. In their investigation they build a model. The model is a fish tank that contains freshwater and saltwater separated by a removable barrier. The freshwater has blue food coloring in it and the saltwater has yellow food coloring in it. At Step 1 the barrier is in place and the different types of water are separated. During Step 2 the barrier is quickly removed. Step 3 shows the water mixing immediately after the barrier has been removed."],
