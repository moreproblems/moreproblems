Dubbed¹ Kyoto Box, it is composed of two cardboard boxes, one inside the other, covered with a sheet of acrylic glass—to help trap the heat from the sun. The inner box is painted with black paint, which absorbs the heat, while the box on the outside is lined with silver foil that reflects any energy that escapes toward the black box. This helps to » create a concentrated source of energy that can be used for cooking."],
