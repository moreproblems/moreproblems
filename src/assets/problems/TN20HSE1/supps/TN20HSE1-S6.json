I͟n͟ ͟f͟a͟c͟t͟,͟ ͟m͟o͟s͟t͟ ͟p͟e͟o͟p͟l͟e͟ ͟w͟o͟u͟l͟d͟ ͟n͟o͟t͟ ͟b͟e͟ ͟a͟b͟l͟e͟ ͟t͟o͟ ͟s͟u͟r͟v͟i͟v͟e͟ ͟t͟o͟ ͟m͟a͟k͟e͟ ͟i͟t͟ ͟m͟u͟c͟h͟ ͟l͟o͟n͟g͟e͟r͟ ͟t͟h͟a͟n͟ ͟t͟w͟o͟ ͟o͟r͟ ͟t͟h͟r͟e͟e͟ ͟d͟a͟y͟s͟ ͟w͟i͟t͟h͟o͟u͟t͟ ͟h͟a͟v͟i͟n͟g͟ ͟w͟a͟t͟e͟r͟. This makes sense when you consider that the human body is made up of about 60% water. Water plays several key roles in physical health: protecting joints, preventing injury and fatigue during exercise, a͟n͟d͟ ͟i͟t͟ ͟h͟e͟l͟p͟s͟ ͟k͟e͟e͟p͟ ͟k͟i͟d͟n͟e͟y͟s͟ ͟h͟e͟a͟l͟t͟h͟y͟."],

Water restores the fluid balance to muscles and helps the body transport electrolytes to replace those lost during exercise.

Those vital organs remove waste from the b͟o͟d͟y͟,͟ ͟t͟h͟e͟y also help regulate blood pressure and some bodily fluid levels. Without adequate hydration, kidneys are unable to perform their critical functions. Water’s valuable role in ensuring human health is difficult to overestimate."]
