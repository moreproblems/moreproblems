        ["1", "\tBut after Ms. Evans collected the papers, she made an announcement. “We have a new speed-math champion this week.” She smiled at the new girl, who'd been in class for only three days. “Congratulations, Caroline. As for the rest of you, keep practicing.”"],
        ["2", "\tRaj shook his head. He didn't need to practice. Next Friday, he'd sharpen two pencils. Then the title would be his again."],
        ["3", "\tDuring the next week, Raj couldn't help noticing that Caroline was good at math. She raised her hand a lot, and her answers were always right. Once, when Ms. Evans demonstrated a new kind of division, Caroline already knew how to do it."],
        ["4", "\tBut that doesn't mean she'll beat me again, Raj told himself."],
        ["5", "\tOn Friday afternoon, he was ready."],
        ["6", "\t“”Begin!” Ms. Evans said."],
        ["7", "\tRaj's answers rushed out like water from a faucet."],
        ["8", "\t9 + 8 = 17\n\t16 - 8 = 8\n\t4 x 9 = 36\n\t63 ÷ 7 = 9"],
        ["9", "\tAs he neared the bottom of the paper, his heart beat faster. Maybe he would even finish early!"],
        ["10", "\tHe groaned when his teacher called time. I had just five problems left, he thought."],
        ["11", "\tIt seemed to take forever for Ms. Evans to read off the answers. Finally, he got his paper back. At the top: a big purple 70-his best score ever."],
        ["12", "\tHe nudged Joel. “Watch out, Caroline,” he whispered, pointing at his quiz. “Here comes the new champ.”"],
        ["13", "\tBut for the second week in a row, Raj wasn't the winner."],
        ["14", "\t“Good job, Caroline,” Ms. Evans said, smiling. “A 75! Looks as if the others are going to have to work harder to beat you.”"],
        ["15", "\tAfter the bell rang, Raj crumpled up his quiz and shoved it into his desk. That Caroline! Barging into 4B and taking over the speed-math quiz. Well, she'd better watch out, because from now on, he was going to practice his math like crazy. Then he'd reign as champion again."],
        ["16", "\tHe started on Monday. Addition problems during breakfast. Subtraction while he brushed his teeth. Multiplication on the bus, and division during his after-school snack. Plus, every night before he went to bed, he took a practice quiz. As the week went on, he did better and better."],
        ["17", "\tEven so, when he saw his score in class on Friday-a 79-he didn't feel as sure of winning as he had before. Maybe Caroline had gotten an 80."],
        ["18", "\tWhile Ms. Evans paged through the corrected papers, Raj watched her face. Had his work paid off?"],
        ["19", "\t“Our champion has changed this week,” she said at last. She looked at Raj and smiled. “Congratulations, Raj. You've really improved.”"],
        ["20", "\tThe bell rang, and Joel slapped him on the back. “You sure showed Caroline, didn't you?” he whispered. “I'll bet she ... ”"],
        ["21", "\tHe trailed off. Caroline was standing right in front of Raj's desk. “Good job on the quiz,” she said."],
        ["22", "\t“Thanks,” Raj replied. Then he added, “You, too-I mean, winning the past two weeks. I thought you were going to beat me again today.”"],
        ["23", "\tCaroline shrugged. “At my old school, I was the best at math, so I always won. It's fun to have some competition here. It makes math more exciting.”"],
        ["24", "\tFun? Exciting? Raj stared at her. What was fun about losing?"],
        ["25", "\t“Are you going to try to win the title back next Friday?” he asked."],
        ["26", "\t“Of course.” She patted her backpack and smiled. “I've got my flashcards right here.”"],
        ["27", "\t“I've got mine, too,” he said quickly, pulling them out of his desk."],
        ["28", "\t“Great!” she said. “Well, see you Monday. And good luck, champ.”"],
        ["29", "\tRaj grinned at the teasing. Maybe math was more fun this way. “Yeah. See you Monday, Caroline.”"]
