Fossil evidence supports the idea that modern corn, also known as maize, is a descendent of teosinte plants. Over time, people chose to plant teosinte seeds from the larger and more productive plants. The size and number of kernels produced in each generation increased and, over thousands of years of breeding, resulted in modern corn plants."],

Aurochs are one of the earlier cattle species and are ancestors of many modern cattle species. Aurochs were large cattle with long horns, fed on grasses and other plants, and lived in grassland habitats of Europe and Asia. The large horns helped the aurochs protect themselves and their offspring from predators. Most modern cattle have more traits that are desired by people rather than traits that would help them survive in the wild."]
