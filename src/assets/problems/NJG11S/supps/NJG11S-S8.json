        [" ", "An electromagnetic wave is generated when the direction of current is repeatedly reversed. This wave creates an alternating magnetic field. Hard disk drives use a part called a write head to store information as bits. When current goes through the write head, it becomes magnetic, which magnetizes the grains. This magnetic interaction allows information to be stored in the magnetized grains of the disk as either a “0” or a “1,” with each 0 or 1 being considered a single bit. This system of using zeros and ones to store information is known as binary code. Bits are shown as downward- or upward- pointing arrows in Figure 1."],
