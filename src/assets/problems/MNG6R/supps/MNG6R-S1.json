        ["1", "The Siberians are traveling with us to the trade fair, traveling along the coast, their boats piled high with the reindeer skins they have brought to trade. Our dogs run along the shore like shadows, their packs bouncing against their ribs— happy to be out in the late night sun, happy to be free. I am happy, too, gliding along in our skin boat, watching them run, wishing I could stretch my limbs and run with them, run for the sheer joy of it, as they do."],
        ["2", "How glorious it is when summer comes again! Glorious to be out on the open water of the summer sea in the nightlong sun, watching the bright ocean ice drift by, dreamlike, on the smooth dark water. Watching the grassy tundra roll past us, nearly close enough to touch, thick with the smell of sunshine and earth and greenery — 𝐴𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑎!"],
        ["3", "Newborn animals are everywhere, too—birds and caribou and even baby seals— and we ourselves are soon to have a newborn of our own. Nuna, traveling with us, is round as a whale and clumsy in her unaccustomed shape, always forgetting she can no longer bend as fast as a child, and often impatient for her time to come."],
        ["4", "𝐵𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑡'𝑠 ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑓𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡, Mama said one time."],
        ["5", "𝐵𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑖𝑡'𝑠 𝑎 𝑔𝑖𝑟𝑙, 𝑎 𝑏𝑖𝑔 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑔𝑖𝑟𝑙, Aaka had countered, clicking her tongue and frowning the way grandmothers do sometimes. 𝑊𝑒 𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑦!"],
        ["6", "Tupaaq smiled wide, eyeing Aaluk: 𝐺𝑖𝑟𝑙𝑠 𝑐𝑎𝑛 𝑏𝑒 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑 ℎ𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑜, he said, winking at me. 𝐺𝑖𝑟𝑙𝑠 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑠."],
        ["7", "Tupaaq had asked Aaluk to ride in his boat that time, but Aaluk said no, muttering to herself how she'd rather run with the dogs. Aaka had frowned at this, because Tupaaq is from Aaka's village, the village of my father's people, and Aaka favors him."],
        ["8", "𝐼'𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑜, I said. 𝐼'𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑜 𝑖𝑛 𝑇𝑢𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑞'𝑠 𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑡."],
        ["9", "But Mama shook her head."],
        ["10", "𝑌𝑜𝑢'𝑟𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑜 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒, she said."],
        ["11", "Too little for what? I had wondered, tall as I was. I was big, nearly bigger than Aaluk—big enough, certainly, to ride in Tupaaq's well-made boat."],
        ["12", "𝐼'𝑚 𝑏𝑖𝑔 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ, I said. Saying it just like that, too, as bossy as Aaluk."],
        ["13", "𝐵𝑖𝑔 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒 𝑎 𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔.¹ Aaluk laughed. Tupaaq laughed, too, which made my cheeks grow warm."],
        ["14", "𝑊𝑎𝑖𝑡 𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑙 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑤 𝑏𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟, 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑙𝑒 𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔. 𝐽𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑤𝑎𝑖𝑡, Tupaaq said. Which made me feel like the lemming in the story Tupaaq always tells, the one stuck underneath an old sealskin, hollering at the top of his lungs."],
        ["15", "Suddenly, I want to holler, too, sitting here in my father's boat. I had waited so long for this trip to begin, but now, I realize, I'm ready for it to end, for the excitement of the trade fair to start. Waiting to hear the sound of the drums welcoming us into the Sheshalik inlet and waiting to hear the wavering note of the women's voices, clear as water, singing the songs of Sheshalik, the Sheshalik welcoming songs."],
        ["16", "We begin to hear their songs when we are still too far away to even see the people. The drums—we hear the drums first. The sound grows louder and louder, pulling us swiftly across the surface of the water, guiding us toward the spit of land, green with summer, that is Sheshalik."],
        ["17", "As we round the final bend, the drumming begins to throb in the air around us like a heartbeat and the sweet shrillness of the women's voices shoots across the surface of the water in bright arrows of sound."],
        ["18", "Baby Manu, bouncing on her mother's back in the front of our boat, squeals with delight, trying to sing as the women sing. I, too, am barely able to keep myself from squealing along with her."],
        ["19", "My father has raised our flag, the flag of our whalers, and as soon as the drummers see it, their song changes and they begin, at once, to drum one of our own songs, announcing our arrival with our own music. Suddenly I feel very proud to be from the island, proud to claim such a brave song as the song of my own people, hearing it as if with new ears. The drumming grows louder and louder as we approach the shore, and soon the sound of our own voices joins with the sounds of theirs, sweet as birdsong."],
        ["20", "𝑊𝑒𝑙𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔."],
        ["21", "Sheshalik, at first sight, is too big to believe—all the tents, the caribou-skin tents of our people, stretching out along the edge of the beach and reaching up inland as far as the eye can see. Overflowing with the sounds of happiness—the kind of happiness that only comes of many, many people, all coming together as one."],
        ["22", "This is my first impression of the Sheshalik trade fair, that all the people of the world must be here. Everyone in the entire world, all here at Sheshalik, preparing to trade."]
