If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite them are congruent. It follows that the angles ∠RSO and ∠ORS, which are across from the sides of equal length, are congruent. Let x° represent the measure of ∠RSO. It follows that the measure of ∠ORS is also x°. It's given that the measure of ∠ROS is 88°. Because the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, the equation x° + x° + 88° = 180°, or 2x + 88 = 180 can be used to find the measure of ∠RSO. Subtracting 88 from both sides of this equation yields 2x = 92. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields x = 46. Therefore, the measure of ∠RSO, in degrees, is 46.",

Applying the distributive property to the right-hand side of the given equation, 4x(x - 7), yields 4x² - 28x. Thus, the equation becomes x² + x - 56 = 4x² - 28x. Combining like terms on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation yields 0 = (4x² - x²) + (-28x - x) + 56, or 3x² - 29x + 56 = 0. For a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, the quadratic formula gives the solutions to the equation in the form x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a. Substituting 3 for a, -29 for b, and 56 for c from the equation 3x² - 29x + 56 = 0 into the quadratic formula yields x = (29 ± √((-29)² - 4(3)(56)))/(2(3)), or x = 29/6 ± 13/6. It follows that the solutions to the given equation are 29/6 + 13/6 and 29/6 - 13/6. Adding these two solutions gives the sum of the solutions: 29/6 + 13/6 + 29/6 - 13/6, which is equivalent to 29/6 + 29/6, or 29/3  Note that 29/3, 9.666, and 9.667 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.",

This can be represented by the equation x/75 = 32, where x represents the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data set A. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 75 yields x = 75(32), or x = 2,400 meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the buildings in data set A is 2,400 meters. It's also given that data set B consists of the heights of 50 buildings and has a mean of 62 meters.

Since it's given that data set C consists of the heights of the 125 buildings from data sets A and B, it follows that the mean of data set C is the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data sets A and B divided by the number of buildings represented in data sets A and B, or (2,400 + 3,100)/125, which is equivalent to 44 meters.

It's given that the graph of 9x - 10y = 19 is translated down 4 units in the xy-plane. Therefore, the resulting graph can be represented by the equation 9x - 10(y + 4) = 19, or 9x - 10y - 40 = 19. Adding 40 to both sides of this equation yields 9x - 10y = 59. The x-coordinate of the x-intercept of the graph of an equation in the xy-plane is the value of x in the equation when y = 0. Substituting 0 for y in the equation 9x - 10y = 59 yields 9x - 10(0) = 59, or 9x = 59. Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 yields x = 59/9.

Data set A has a frequency of 1 for values 10 and 16, whereas data set B has a frequency of 2 for values 10 and 16. Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a data set; it is larger when there are more values further from the mean, and smaller when there are more values closer to the mean. Since both distributions are symmetric with an odd number of values, the mean of each data set is equal to its median. Thus, each data set has a mean of 13. Since more of the values in data set A are closer to 13 than data set B, it follows that data set A has a smaller standard deviation than data set B. Thus, statement II is false.

The perimeter of a figure is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the figure. Therefore, the perimeter of the isosceles right triangle is l + l + l√2 inches. It's given that the perimeter of the triangle is 94 94 2 + inches. It follows that l + l + l√2 = 94 + 94√2. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields (1 + 1 + √2)l = 94 + 94√2, or (2 + √2)l = 94 + 94√2. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 + 2√2 yields l = (94 + 94√2)/(2 + 2√2). Rationalizing the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation by multiplying the right-hand side of the equation by (2 - 2√2)/(2 - 2√2) yields l = ((94 + 94√2)(2 - 2√2))/((2 + 2√2)(2 - 2√2)). Applying the distributive property to the numerator and to the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation yields l = (188 - 94√2 + 188√2 - 94√4)/(4 - 2√2 + 2√2 - √4). This is equivalent to l = (94√2)/1, or l = 47√2. Therefore, the length, in inches, of one leg of the isosceles right triangle is 47√2.",

A quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0 has exactly one solution if and only if its discriminant, -4ac + b², is equal to zero. It follows that for the given equation, a = -9 and b = 30. Substituting 9- for a and 30 for b into b² - 4ac- yields 30² - 4(-9)(c), or 900 + 36c. Since the discriminant must equal zero, 900 + 36c = 0. Subtracting 36c from both sides of this equation yields 900 = -36c. Dividing each side of this equation by -36 yields -25 = c. Therefore, the value of c is -25.",

                    "Rationale": "A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, Ax + By = C and Dx + Ey = F, are parallel if the coefficients for x and y in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning D/A = E/B; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning F/C is not equal to D/A or E/B. The first equation in the given system is (3/2)y - (1/4)x = 2/3 - (3/2)y. Multiplying each side of this equation by 12 yields 18y - 3x = 8 - 18y. Adding 18y to each side of this equation yields 36y - 3x = 8, or -3x + 36y = 8. The second equation in the given system is (1/2)x + 3/2 = py + 9/2. Multiplying each side of this equation by 2 yields x + 3 = 2py + 9. Subtracting 2py from each side of this equation yields x + 3 - 2py = 9. Subtracting 3 from each side of this equation yields x - 2py = 6. Therefore, the two equations in the given system, written in standard form, are -3x + 36y = 8 and x - 2py = 6. As previously stated, if this system has no solution, the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct, meaning the proportion 1/(-3) = (-2p)/36, or -1/3 = -p/18, is true and the proportion 6/8 = 1/(-3) is not true. The proportion 6/8 = 1/(-3) is not true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, -1/3 = -p/18, by -18 yields p = 6. Therefore, if the system has no solution, then the value of p is 6.",
