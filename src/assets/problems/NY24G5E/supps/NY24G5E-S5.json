        ["1", "\tA store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Wasps declared positively that it belonged to them. The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs. The argument grew very pointed, and it looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle, when at last, with much good sense, they agreed to let a judge decide the matter. So they brought the case before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of the woods."],

When the case came up again, both sides had a large number of witnesses. An Ant was the first to take the stand, and was about to be cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court."],

        ["6", "\tThe Wasps protested loudly. Wise Judge Hornet quickly understood why they did so: They knew they could not build a honey comb and fill it with honey."],
        ["7", "\t“It is clear,” said the Judge, “who made the comb and who could not have made it. The honey belongs to the Bees.”"]
