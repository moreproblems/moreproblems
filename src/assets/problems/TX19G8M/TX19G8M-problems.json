Therefore the student should have recognized the need to use the Pythagorean theorem to answer this question. The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c², where the variables a and b represent the side lengths of the legs of the right triangle and c represents the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side, which is opposite the 90-degree angle)) shows the relationships between the squares of the side lengths of the right triangle. If n, l, and k represent the lengths of the sides of Square N, Square L, and Square K, respectively, then n² equals the area of Square N, l² equals the area of Square L, and k² equals the area of Square K. Since these squares are formed using the side lengths of the right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds that n² + l² = k². Thus the area of Square N plus the area of Square L equals the area of Square K.",

The direction the decimal point is moved determines whether the exponent is positive or negative. Moving the decimal point to the right creates a negative exponent. Moving the decimal point to the left creates a positive exponent. Since the decimal point moves to the right 3 places, the exponent is −3, resulting in 1.429 × 10⁻³.",

Given the length of two sides of a right triangle, the length of the third side can be determined by using the Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c². The c in the Pythagorean theorem represents the length of the longest side (which is opposite the 90-degree angle), in this case the diagonal, while a and b represent the other two sides (in no particular order). To determine the length of the diagonal in inches, the values for a and b should be substituted into the Pythagorean theorem, (15)² + (8)² = c². To solve for c, the student should have calculated √((15)² + (8)²) = √(c²) or √((15 •15) + (8 •8)) = c, which yields √289 = c and when simplified equals 17.",
