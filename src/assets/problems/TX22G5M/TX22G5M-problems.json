Two numbers have a 1 in the ones place (11.450, 11.50), whereas the remaining three (greater) numbers have a 2 in the tens place (12.068, 12.495, 12.085).

Again, looking at the tenths place, the student could have determined that 12.495 is greater than 12.068 and 12.085 because 4 is greater than 0. Finally, looking at the hundredths place, the student could have ordered 12.068 before 12.085 because 6 is less than 8.
