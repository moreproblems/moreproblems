Whole numbers are all of the positive integers and zero. The student should have determined that this Venn diagram has the classifications in the right order. Then the student should have determined that since –648 can be written as –648/1, it is a rational number, and that since –648 is negative and has no decimal or fractional part, it is also an integer.
