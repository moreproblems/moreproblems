            ":box:Early experimenters with building motor vehicles were scattered across the northeastern United States from Massachusetts to Wisconsin, and when commercial production began in the 1890s, the northeast was the center of activity. In the late 1890s, of the hundreds of firms organized to produce motor vehicles, only one — the Olds Motor Works — located in Detroit. As early as 1903, however, the best-selling cars were made in southeastern Michigan, and by 1913, 80 percent of production was concentrated in that area. . . .\n\nAlthough independent producers outside of Michigan survived until after World War II, motor vehicle production became highly clustered in southeastern Michigan rather than dispersed among other Midwestern states. As early as 1903, the three leading producers were based in Michigan, including Olds, which built 4,000 cars that year, and Ford and Cadillac, which each built approximately 1,700. The 1904 US Census of Manufactures . . . revealed that 42 percent of all cars were made in Michigan. Five years later . . . Michigan’s share of national production had climbed to 51 percent.\n\nAutomotive production concentrated in southeastern Michigan because the industry’s most successful pioneers either grew up in the area or migrated there. . . . However, founders of new businesses do not operate in a social and economic vacuum; they build on their knowledge of a community’s experience in successfully manufacturing other products.\n\nSoutheastern Michigan attracted or retained the most successful motor vehicle producers, because industries from which automotive technology derived were already thriving in the region. Mechanics and engineers skilled in other industries . . . applied their expertise to experimenting with motor vehicles. Then, when early auto makers progressed . . . to commercial production, they turned to the existing industries for skilled workers.\n\nTopping a long list of problems faced by early motor vehicle producers, practical designs had to be found for three components — an engine to propel the vehicle, a drivetrain to convert engine power to motion, and a platform or chassis strong enough to hold both passengers and the power sources. Two of these three problems were solved largely through technology borrowed from industries which had already clustered in southeastern Michigan. At the turn of the century, [this area] was a center for machine shops with experience building gasoline-powered engines and for carriage makers with experience building chassis.\n\nGASOLINE ENGINES\n\n. . . Early gasoline engines were more powerful and mechanically reliable than the competitors [electric and steam] and with crude petroleum less than five cents a barrel, inexpensive to operate. Gasoline-powered automobiles were more suitable for rough roads in rural areas, where half of the American population still lived at the turn of the century. Many rural residents were already familiar with gasoline engines, which had been commonly installed in agricultural equipment.\n\nExperience with building gasoline engines gave Michigan automotive manufacturers a critical early technological lead over competitors elsewhere in the country. Michigan had become a leading center for the production of gasoline engines for agricultural and marine uses. Detroit’s shipyards were early converts to gasoline engines in part because of dissatisfaction with the heating capacity of locally mined coal. . . .\n\nCARRIAGE-MAKERS\n\nThe popular early name for the automobile — the horseless carriage — reveals the importance of the carriage industry in the development of the motor vehicle industry. . . .\n\nCarriage-makers clustered in Flint to take advantage of proximity [nearness]to Michigan’s extensive hardwood forests.\n\n\t— James Rubenstein, The Changing U.S. Auto Industry, 1992",
