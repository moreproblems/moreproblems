        ["1", "When one thinks of ancient Egyptian queens, Cleopatra is probably the name that comes to mind. However, female rulers were surprisingly common in ancient Egypt, and some of the most i͟n͟f͟l͟u͟e͟n͟c͟h͟i͟a͟l royals in Egyptian history were women. Compared to women in other ancient cultures, Egyptian women had more rights: they could own land, choose their own husbands, and participate in government."],
        ["2", "One of the first known female rulers, MerNeith, ruled Egypt until her infant son was old enough to take the throne. Despite being a sort of “placeholder,” ancient artifacts show that MerNeith governed the kingdom and likely passed laws during this time. Nefertiti is one of the most famous Egyptian queens. She ruled during Egypt's most prosperous time and was responsible for reshaping the culture's religious beliefs. Although she ruled a͟l͟o͟n͟g͟s͟i͟d͟e͟ ͟h͟e͟r͟ ͟h͟u͟s͟b͟a͟n͟d͟,͟ ͟s͟h͟e͟ ͟i͟s͟ ͟d͟e͟p͟i͟c͟t͟e͟d far more often than he is in sculptures and artwork, suggesting that the people considered her the more important ruler."],
        ["3", "Though she's not as famous as others, Hatshepsut was one of the most important Egyptian queens in history. T͟h͟e͟ ͟f͟u͟l͟l͟ ͟t͟i͟t͟l͟e͟ ͟a͟n͟d͟ ͟p͟o͟w͟e͟r͟s͟ ͟o͟f͟ ͟a͟ ͟p͟h͟a͟r͟o͟a͟h͟ ͟w͟e͟r͟e͟ ͟a͟s͟s͟u͟m͟e͟d͟ ͟b͟y͟ ͟h͟e͟r͟. She often went so far as dressing as a man and having her subjects refer to her as “King” to ensure respect. Hatshepsut ruled for more than 20 years and left the kingdom in far better condition politically and economically than when she first took power. She also prepared her stepson to rule after her, and he expanded Egypt's empire to its largest size."]
