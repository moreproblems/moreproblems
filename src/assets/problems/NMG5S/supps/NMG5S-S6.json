The scientist measured the mass of a small tree. Then he measured the mass of dry soil that he put into a container and planted the small tree in the container. He took care of the tree as the tree grew larger. Five years later, the scientist took the tree out of the container and dried the soil. Then he measured the mass of the tree and the dry soil again. The table shows the results of the scientist's investigation."],
