Lift the balloon so that the baking soda falls into the bottle with vinegar.\n\n5. Wait one minute.\n\n6. Carefully remove the balloon from the bottle without allowing any gas to escape.\n\n7. Measure the mass of the balloon filled with gas.\n\n8. Calculate the mass of gas produced by subtracting the mass of the balloon from the mass of the balloon filled with gas.\n\n9.
