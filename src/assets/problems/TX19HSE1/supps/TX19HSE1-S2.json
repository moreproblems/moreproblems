(8) Her classroom is crowded, and she can't always get the one-on-one attention that she needs to understand a new concept. (9) She has told me that she has many friends who also need help.

        ["", "\t(12) According to an article published in the November 2005 Education World, elementary school students raised their reading levels significantly in a short period of time after being tutored by high school students. (13) Furthermore, volunteering seems to have a positive influence on the high school mentors themselves. (14) As students learn how to be good mentors, they focus on effective communication skills, including how to share and how to listen. (15) Generally speaking, these skills are valuable for everyone. (16) Additionally, mentors get the satisfaction of meaningfully contributing to their community and future generations. (17) What student, at any age, wouldn't be proud to have that kind of influence?"],
        ["", "\t(18) Because mentoring programs have proven to be so successful, they now exist in schools around the country. (19) Some schools pair high school students with elementary students to practice computer skills, to play sports, to learn to play a musical instrument, or to discover how to be a good citizen. (20) I propose that our school begin by setting up a program that focuses on academic tutoring. (21) Fortunately, starting the program would require only a few students available and willing to help others. (22) I believe that many students would volunteer to be mentors, which would help children at all age levels in our school district. (23) Our high school has an opportunity to allow its students to influence the future today, and it should do so by starting a mentoring program."]
