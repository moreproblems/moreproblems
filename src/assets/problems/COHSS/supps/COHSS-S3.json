        [" ", "A student boils water for pasta and notices that the water boils faster when there is a lid on the pot. The student wonders whether energy can be saved by boiling water with the lid on. The student conducts an experiment to investigate the energy used to boil water at sea level under several different conditions. The experiment uses a hot plate with settings given in watts (W). The student compares the time it takes for the water to boil, in seconds (s), to the amount of electrical energy used, in watt-hours (Wh), for these four trials:"],
