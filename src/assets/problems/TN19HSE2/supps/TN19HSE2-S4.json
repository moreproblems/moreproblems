        [" ", "\tThe first artificial body parts, or prostheses, were probably made for injured knights in the 1600s. Since that time, the technology to build prostheses has steadily improved. Today, people have [artificial hearts, knees and hips made of plastic, and ankles of titanium]."],
        [" ", "\tOnly recently, however, has the latest manufacturing technology emerged — 3D printing. Although this technology is referred to as printing, it is unlike traditional printing in many ways. [While a 3D printer is doing its printing], a computer deposits layers of material to form a three–dimensional object. This technology seems ideal for creating replacement body parts for people [who need them]."],
        [" ", "\tThe use of 3D printers has several advantages over other manufacturing methods. For one thing, each part is printed [individually, therefore,] it can be precisely customized for the person who will use it. For another thing, 3D printers can create extremely complex body parts, such as organ tissues."],
        [" ", "\tOne remarkable application of 3D printing is to create tissue structures that integrate with the body. In these cases, scientists build biodegradable structures [that contains] actual human cells. When doctors implant a structure, the body's blood vessels and nerves grow into the structure. The structure eventually dissolves as the person's own living tissues replace it."]
