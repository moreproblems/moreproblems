Did you know that you could travel across the state of Nebraska on such a train almost as fast as if you flew in an airplane? This is all possible on a Maglev train. Maglev is short for 'magnetic levitation.' Maglev trains use powerful electromagnets to float a train car above a rail or guide. Functioning like regular bar magnets, the matching poles of these powerful electromagnets repel one another. This results in a magnetic field strong enough to lift a train.”\n\nThe student also finds a diagram showing magnetic levitation.",
