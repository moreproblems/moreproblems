        [" ", "Students decide to replace part of a school's grass lawn with native plants. Healthy grass lawns usually need a lot of care to be healthy. Native plants need less care because they are adapted to grow well in local conditions. The students decide to use buffalo grass, which is native to the school area. Buffalo grass needs less water and fertilizer than other types of grass and can live through periods without rain. Like other types of grass, buffalo grass spreads out to cover the ground. Aboveground stems, called stolons, grow outward from existing grass plants. New leaves and roots grow from the stolons, forming new plants. Buffalo grass only grows 8–10 inches high and the leaves tend to topple over and look short, so it requires less mowing as well."],

        [" ", "Native plants are also more likely to attract native wildlife and pollinators. Pollinators can be birds, such as hummingbirds, or insects, such as bees and butterflies. Flowering plants produce pollen and nectar. These food sources attract pollinators. As the pollinators move from flower to flower collecting food, they transfer pollen from one plant to the next. The pollen transfer or “pollination” is a necessary step in the production of seeds that grow into new plants. The students choose plants based on how well they will grow in local conditions and the kinds of pollinators they will attract."],
        [" ", "Many pollinators also benefit from a source of water, such as a birdbath, for drinking and washing. A human-made pond can even attract frogs to a garden."]
