        [" ", "\t𝟏. Anyone who tours Utah's Fishlake National Forest is likely to marvel at its beautiful grove of aspen trees. 𝟐. However, the 47,000 trees in this woodlands area are not individual trees. 𝟑. They share a single root system and even originated from the same seed. 𝟒. As such, the Pando Clone is made up by them and are believed by scientists to be the world's largest living thing."],
        [" ", "\t𝟓. Pando is a Latin word that means “I spread.” 𝟔. It is an apt name for this s͟u͟p͟e͟r͟ ͟h͟u͟g͟e tree system. 𝟕. The Pando Clone expands across 106 acres of land and weighs a͟p͟p͟r͟o͟x͟i͟m͟a͟t͟e͟l͟y 13 million pounds. 𝟖. The aspen copies, or clones, itself by shooting long stem-like roots up out of the soil."],
        [" ", "\t𝟗. Pando is not only one of the world's largest living things; it is also one of its oldest. 𝟏𝟎. Scientists e͟x͟p͟e͟c͟t that Pando is at least 80,000 years old, and possibly 1 million years old. 𝟏𝟏. Each stem turns into a new aspen, though all the trees are connected to each other and all share the same genetic material."],
        [" ", "\t𝟏𝟐. Unfortunately, Pando is facing several threats. 𝟏𝟑. Disease and insects have also killed off certain parts of it. 𝟏𝟒. Scientists are worried that Pando is not cloning itself as fast as creatures and other environmental changes are destroying it."],
        [" ", "\t𝟏𝟓. To protect this living treasure, the National Forest Service has fenced off sections of the Pando Clone. 𝟏𝟔. Although animals sometimes find their way around the fence, many young stems in the enclosed areas appear to be thriving. 𝟏𝟕. Rangers are also using forest maintenance methods such as controlled cuts and burns to encourage new growth. 𝟏𝟖. This too is helping preserve this ancient giant for future generations to enjoy."]
