        [" ", "The Galápagos Islands are famous for unusual animals found nowhere else on Earth. Spanish explorers named the islands Galápagos, which means “tortoise,” because of the giant tortoises they found there. The volcanic islands have many mountains, craters, and cliffs. Most islands are warm and get very little rainfall. The islands have cactus forests growing in dry lowlands and thick plants covering the humid highlands. The plant life affects the types of animals that can live on each island. The map shows the climate zones of the islands."],

        [" ", "In the nineteenth century, Charles Darwin studied differences in plants and animals on the islands to explain how living things change over time. Today, most of the islands are national parks. Many people and scientists come from all over the world to visit and study the animals found on the islands."]
