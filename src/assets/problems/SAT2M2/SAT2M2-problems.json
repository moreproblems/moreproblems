If the equation for line p is rewritten in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants, then m is the slope of the line and (0, b) is its y-intercept. Subtracting 18x from both sides of the equation 2y + 18x = 9 yields 2y = -18x + 9. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields y= -9x + 9/2. It follows that the slope of line p is -9. The negative reciprocal of a number is -1 divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of -9 is (-1)/(-9), or 1/9. Thus, the slope of line r is 1/9.",

The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy-plane intersects the y-axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y-axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius. It follows that the x-coordinate of the circle's center must be equivalent to the length of the circle's radius. In other words, if the graph of (x - h)² + (y - k)²= r² is a circle that intersects the y-axis at exactly one point, then r = |h| must be true. The equation in choice C is (x - 4)² +(y - 9)² = 16, or (x - 4)² +(y - 9)² = 4². This equation is in the form (x - h) + (y - k)² = r², where h = 4, k = 9, and r = 4, and represents a circle in the xy-plane with center (4,9) and radius of length 4. Substituting 4 for r and 4 for h in the equation r = |h| yields 4 = |4|, or 4 = 4, which is true. Therefore, the equation in choice C represents a circle in the xy-plane that intersects the y-axis at exactly one point.",

It follows that if h represents the length, in centimeters, of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, h² = 24² + 21². This equation is equivalent to h² = 1,017. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields h = √1,017. This equation can be rewritten as h = √(9 • 113), or h = √9 • √113. This equation is equivalent to h = 3√113. It's given that the length of the triangle's hypotenuse, in centimeters, can be written in the form 3√d. It follows that the value of d is 113.",
