        [" ", "Mount Saint Helens is a volcano that erupted in 1980 and caused the largest debris landslide in United States history. Ash from the eruption, known as ash fallout, was blown high into the atmosphere and circled the globe in two weeks, sending ash debris thousands of miles away from the volcano."],

        [" ", "The eruption rapidly changed Earth's surface. The peak of Mount Saint Helens was gone, forests were destroyed, and lakes and ponds were flooded as they filled with rock debris from the landslide. An area called the Pumice Plain formed when lava and ash covered the base of the mountain, leaving a lifeless area of light-gray rock."],
        [" ", "Scientists studied nature's return to the Pumice Plain. Some of the first species to return were ground beetles. The beetles were able to eat other insects that had been blown into the area. Other species returned faster than scientists had expected, starting with bacteria, small mammals that survived underground, birds that ate the beetles, and some plants. Life is continuing to slowly return to the Pumice Plain."]
