        ["1", "Every year, millions of wildebeest journey through northern Tanzania's Serengeti Plain seeking fresh rainfall. T͟h͟e͟ ͟S͟e͟r͟e͟n͟g͟e͟t͟i͟,͟ ͟w͟h͟e͟r͟e͟ ͟n͟a͟t͟u͟r͟a͟l͟ ͟r͟e͟s͟o͟u͟r͟c͟e͟s͟ ͟b͟r͟i͟m͟,͟ ͟i͟s͟ ͟a͟ ͟l͟a͟r͟g͟e͟ ͟r͟e͟g͟i͟o͟n͟ ͟i͟n͟ ͟T͟a͟n͟z͟a͟n͟i͟a͟,͟ ͟a͟ ͟c͟o͟u͟n͟t͟r͟y͟ ͟i͟n͟ ͟A͟f͟r͟i͟c͟a͟. During the Great Wildebeest Migration, these cattle-like creatures search for any fresh grassland brought by rain. Zebras and gazelles follow the wildebeest, hoping to find the same food sources."],
        ["2", "The traveling animals move in a circular pattern. Though their yearly route stays the same, the amount of rainfall varies each year. The herds begin their journey on the southern edge of the Serengeti around late November and December. This area is near the m͟a͟s͟s͟i͟v͟e͟ ͟v͟i͟b͟r͟a͟n͟t͟ ͟c͟o͟n͟s͟e͟r͟v͟a͟t͟i͟o͟n͟ ͟a͟r͟e͟a where a volcanic crater helps shelter the wildlife. As the seasons change, the herds push north. Depending on the year, they will brave a dramatic river crossing into Maasai Mara, an area in southwestern Kenya. Another danger wildebeest may face is predators, such as lions or cheetahs."],
        ["3", "Nature often paints a peaceful image, but the Great Serengeti Wildebeest Migration is the opposite; the fight for e͟s͟s͟e͟n͟t͟i͟e͟l͟ resources is fierce. The excitement of this journey is what makes it such an amazing sight. Few other events on Earth can match the Great Serengeti Wildebeest Migration's awe-inspiring scale."]
