        ["1", "\tTwo otters were fishing one day and had the good fortune to catch a huge pike, three feet long and almost as heavy as they were. The pike put up a great fight and both otters were completely exhausted by the time they landed their fish."],
        ["2", "\tWhen the pike was safely grounded, the two friends began to quarrel about how to divide their catch. They could not agree on who should get the head and who should get the tail, and to whom belonged the greater share."],
        ["3", "\tAlong came a fox and stopped to listen to their dispute. The two otters turned to him."],
        ["4", "\t“We caught this pike together,” they explained. “But we cannot agree on how to divide him between us. Will you help us make a fair division?”"],
        ["5", "\tThe fox said gravely: “I have judged many cases like this, and I am known far and wide for my skill and fairness in such matters.”"],
        ["6", "\tThe fox cut the pike in three parts, and asked: “Who saw the pike first?”"],
        ["7", "\t“I did,” said one otter."],
        ["8", "\t“Then to you belongs the head,” said the fox, and gave him the head."],
        ["9", "\tHe asked again: “Who helped secure the fish on the ground?”"],
        ["10", "\t“I did,” said the second otter."],
        ["11", "\t“Then to you justly belongs the tail,” said the fox, and gave him the fishtail."],
        ["12", "\t“But what of the body of the fish?” asked the otters."],
        ["13", "\t“That is my share for acting as judge,” said the fox as he ran off with most of the great pike in his mouth."]
