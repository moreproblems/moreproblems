        ["1", "“SURPRISE!”"],
        ["2", "I look over the shoulder of my makeup artist, Sam, who, like me, jumped when the door flew open. He pulled his mascara wand away faster than a hand on a hot stove, smearing some on my cheek."],
        ["3", "“Oh my gosh, what are you doing here?” I scream when I see my best friend, who’s supposed to be back in Tennessee, standing in the door of my dressing room, arms open wide."],
        ["4", "“I came to see your first professional football game,” Stella teases, gesturing to the black line under my eye."],
        ["5", "“Ha-ha,” Sam deadpans."],
        ["6", "I jump up, and we meet in the middle of the room. Stella’s giant hug is just the thing I need to distract me from the ticking clock and the thousands— thousands—of people taking their seats in the arena at this very moment. Then her mom walks in behind her."],
        ["7", "“Shannon!” I shout, and I rush her for a big hug as well."],
        ["8", "“Oh, Bird, it’s good to see you,” she says, her dangly earrings tinkling in my ear as we embrace."],
        ["9", "“I can’t believe nobody told me y’all were coming,” I say as Sam politely yet firmly leads me back to my makeup chair."],
        ["10", "Stella leans toward my mirror, straightening her thick bangs. “We wanted it to be a surprise,” she says with a grin."],
        ["11", "When I signed with Open Highway at the end of last summer, Dan paired me up with an established songwriter, Shannon Crossley. She helped pen a lot of the songs on Wildflower and really took me under her wing. That’s how I met Stella, and honestly, I don’t know what I’d do without either of them."],
        ["12", "“You look amazing, Bird,” Stella says as Sam finishes the touch-up. “Like yourself, but even better somehow. It’s like you’re glowing.”"],
        ["13", "I turn toward the mirror and take myself in. I see a tall, skinny girl with long, wavy, coppery hair wearing a jean jacket, white tank top, magenta shorts, and an incredible pair of custom-made Justin¹ boots."],
        ["14", "“What’d your dad say about those Daisy Dukes²?” Shannon asks with a sly smile."],
        ["15", "“He doesn’t like them, but apparently he doesn’t get a vote,” my dad answers as he walks into the room with my mom and brothers."],
        ["16", "“Was she surprised?” Dylan asks as he throws an arm around Stella’s shoulders."],
        ["17", "“Totally,” she says, quite smug, crossing her arms."],
        ["18", "“You two and your schemes,” I say, pointing at them accusatorily. Last Christmas I thought I lost my lucky rock—one I’d found the day I was offered a record deal and carried with me all the time—but in reality, Dylan had swiped it when I wasn’t looking. He gave it to Stella, who encased it in silver wire and attached it to a long silver chain, making it into a necklace so I’d always have it with me. It’s the best gift I’ve ever gotten. No matter how my stylist dresses me, I never take it off."],
        ["19", "As my brothers help themselves to the contents of my minifridge, and everybody else settles in around me, I realize that my nerves have morphed into excited energy. I feel revved up, ready, like a car gunning its engine at the starting line. I have people here—my people—and I’m ready to do this thing!"],
        ["20", "“Bird, it’s almost time,” Jordan says, knocking on the door."],
        ["21", "“Okay, thanks.”"],
        ["22", "She vanishes, on to her next stage-managing duty."],
        ["23", "“Well, gang, it’s been a wild year, that’s for sure,” my dad says as he circles us up. I squeeze between Dylan and Jacob, and we join hands just like the old days when we were touring together as the Barrett Family Band, playing . . . almost every day of the year. “I’ve gone from Bird’s father, to her band leader, to her manager, and to who-knows-what next! But let me tell you something, that girl is happiest with this group of people around her.”"],
        ["24", "My eyes blur all of a sudden, and I look up, blinking rapidly, determined, as my dad goes on, not to cry, even if they are happy tears. Then both of my . . . brothers squeeze my hands, and it happens anyway. I lean over and dab a wet cheek on each of their sleeves, and they pretend to hate it."],
        ["25", "“And I’ll tell you one more thing,” my dad continues. “She has a level head, even with all this craziness. You all are our family”—I look over at Stella, who flashes me a megawatt smile—“and all this success is due in part to your support. So we thank you.”"]
