        [" ", "\tEver since [L1] [introducing coffee] to Italy several centuries ago, it has been a ubiquitous part of Italian culture. [L2] [However,] coffee is so central to Italian culture that one cannot visit any city or town in Italy without seeing several coffeehouses (called caffetterie in Italian). Such coffeehouses have existed since 1640, when the first was established in Venice, and [L3] [it has] since become a part of Italy's national identity. It is not uncommon in Italy for people to make two to three trips a day to their favorite caffetteria, and often people are so selective about their coffee that they will frequent only one establishment. But it is not simply the coffee that creates such enthusiasm for coffeehouses among those [L4] [which love] them; the social aspect of the caffetteria may play nearly as great a role as the coffee itself."],
        [" ", "\tEach caffetteria functions as a social hub in its neighborhood, and the way in which most patrons consume their coffee [L5] [contribute] to this fact. Few caffetteria patrons sit at tables, since most coffeehouses in Italy charge a premium for table service, [L6] [although sometimes it's worth the cost to be able to sit and rest.] Nor can patrons take their drinks elsewhere: to-go cups are not available at typical coffeehouses. [L7] [Instead, most regular patrons of a caffetteria drink their coffee standing. They do this, often shoulder-to-shoulder, at a counter or bar.] Normally, those drinking their coffee at a bar will also chat with each other and the person making coffee behind the bar. This practice, which combines social interaction with coffee drinking, is the most popular way to enjoy a cup of coffee in Italy."],
        [" ", "\t[L8] Indeed, many Italian coffee enthusiasts agree that there is only one [L9] correct way to make coffee: this involves filtering water through freshly ground coffee beans at specific temperatures and pressures, which produces the concentrated form of coffee known as espresso. This type of coffee is drunk in Italy in several forms, either unadulterated or with varying amounts of milk, and each form has a different name. An espresso mixed with frothed and steamed milk [L10] [is a cappuccino: for example,] while an espresso with just a dollop of steamed milk on top is a caff√® macchiato. There are also respected traditions about when these different coffee drinks should be consumed: while cappuccino is a popular morning drink, espresso, either plain or diluted with water, is usually the drink of choice for coffee drinkers in Italy in the afternoon and evening.
