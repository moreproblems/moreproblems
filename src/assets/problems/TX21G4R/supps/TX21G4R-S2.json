I really don't know why.\nThere is nothing I like more than making rhymes on the fly.\nYes, it's hard sometimes, to go out on a limb\nAnd share secret thoughts with your family and friends.\nBut I'm realizing now, if I let folks bring me down,\nI'll be teaching little Sammy to let her passions drown.\nThat wouldn't be cool, and I must not forget that\nLife's hard enough, sister, so let's have some fun with it! We can use our rapping skills almost all the time\nSpelling words with cool rhythms and a rhyme in every line!"]
