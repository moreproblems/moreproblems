Traveling east across the Atlantic, Nelie took just one bag in order to move quickly. As she traveled, she wrote. She telegraphed her articles about people and places to the newspaper.

Along the way, every train stop was a “maze of happy greetings, happy wishes, congratulating telegrams, fruit, flowers, loud cheers, wild hurrahs, rapid hand-shaking” she wrote. While traveling through France, Nelie was thrilled to meet Jules Verne, author of the book that inspired her trip, Around the World in 80 Days."],
