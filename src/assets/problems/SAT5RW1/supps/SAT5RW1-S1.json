        [" ", "near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with"],
        [" ", "tables for two along the walls and tables for four"],
        [" ", "down the middle. The decoration was art moderne,"],
        ["5", "except for the series of murals depicting the four"],

        [" ", "and never absolutely legible. ON nearly every other"],
        ["15", "page there was some marginal notation, either in ink"],
        [" ", "or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had"],
        [" ", "upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were"],

        [" ", "the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and"],
        [" ", "again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he"],
        [" ", "chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that"],
        [" ", "he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of"],
        ["25", "Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in"],
        [" ", "November of the same year, and all the powers"],
        [" ", "engaged in the war on either side sent"],
        [" ", "plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and"],
        [" ", "important assembly ever convoked to discuss and"],

        [" ", "as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They"],
        [" ", "laughed more than there seemed any occasion for,"],
        [" ", "while they were deciding between soup and shrimp"],
        ["55", "cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. but it was"],
        [" ", "the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch"],
        [" ", "of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim"],

        [" ", "and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and"],
        [" ", "Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a"],

        ["65", "were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at"],

        [" ", "characters than it is to other people, but physical"],
        [" ", "decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more"],
        [" ", "noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his"],
        ["75", "scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight"],
        [" ", "also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he"],
