Each day, girls and boys gathered at the Nordkamp Center, an after-school drop-in center, for soup. Then most of the boys would leave to play soccer in a nearby dirt field while the girls remained at the center to jump rope, braid hair, or read books."],
        ["2", "\tCenter counselor Mary Beth Gallagher loved soccer and knew that the girls would love it, too. So she organized a girls' team with players under the age of 12. She knew it would be the youngest girls' soccer team in the whole country. No one knew then that this team would completely change the lives of girls in Namibia."],
        ["3", "\tIt wasn't long before the girls loved the game, even though their field was filled with stones, thorns, and broken glass. Because they had no other girls' teams to compete with, Mary Beth a͟r͟r͟a͟n͟g͟e͟d matches against the boys' teams. The boys were bigger and tougher, but the girls didn't back down. Like the boys, the girls learned to play fast and smart, and they learned ways to outsmart their stronger opponents."],

An American soccer team from Briarcliff Manor, New York, heard about them from friends and immediately sent all their uniforms and shoes to their “soccer sisters.” When the bright orange uniforms arrived, the Nordkamp girls danced with delight."],

The Pumpkins beat that first team and then the next. But the strain began to show in the third match. This team was stronger, and the game was tied up until the last minute. Emma, the Pumpkins' kicker, was the Nordkamp girls' only hope."],

        ["12", "\tThe Pumpkins felt like the tournament winners, even though they had one more match to play. The only problem? Their final opponents had not yet arrived. Sitting on the grass and eating peanut-butter sandwiches, the Pumpkins waited impatiently for the team to show up. With only 10 minutes left before the deadline, two big buses marked Botswana pulled through the gate. They were nine hours late!"],

He told the Pumpkins to forfeit so they could all go home. That made the Pumpkins angry. They took to the field. They didn't come to quit."],
