Some m͟i͟g͟r͟a͟t͟o͟r͟y birds, like the painted bunting, travel as little as a few hundred miles per year. Others, like the Arctic tern, travel up to 22,000 miles annually."],
        ["", "Birds do not make these long and tiring journeys just to avoid cold weather. They travel for food, which can be hard to find in winter. Some birds even fly to another hemisphere to make sure they’ll have enough to eat. Most do not return north until the spring or summer, when i͟t͟ ͟i͟s much more abundant. That is when there are new caterpillars, insects, and tree blossoms to eat."],
