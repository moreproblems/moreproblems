        ["6", "\tYour ears work by collecting sounds. Sounds make movements in the air called sound waves. Sound waves travel into your ears through the ear canal."],
        ["7", "\tThe sound waves make your eardrum move. As your eardrum moves it moves three tiny bones in your ear. Inside your ear these movements are picked up and sent as signals to your brain..."],

        ["9", "\tSmells are carried in the air and go into your nose as you breathe. There are tiny parts at the top of your nose that pick up smells."],
        ["10", "\tYour nose sends signals about the smells to your brain. Your brain has lots of smells stored in your memory. Your brain can tell you what each smell is."],

        ["16", "\tYour brain sorts and stores all the signals from your senses. Then it instantly sends millions of messages back to your body parts. Your brain tells all the different parts of your body what is happening and what to do."]
