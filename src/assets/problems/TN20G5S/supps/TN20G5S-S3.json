The teacher decides to take the students on a field trip to the Sudekum Planetarium located in the Adventure Science Center in Nashville. The teacher tells the students that there are two goals for the field trip. The first goal is to be able to identify different objects in the solar system based on their characteristics. The second goal is to understand how mass and distance affect the force of gravity between objects."],
        [" ", "When the students arrive at the planetarium they participate in two activities. The first activity is watching a presentation about different objects in the solar system. The students take notes about what they are learning. Student 1 draws sketches of five different objects in the solar system. Student 2 makes a table to show the characteristics of the same five objects. Student 3 records observations from the presentation. The students’ work is shown."],
