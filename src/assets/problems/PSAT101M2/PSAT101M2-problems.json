Since the area of Janice's garden is 5,670 square feet, it follows that w(3w – 9) = 5,670, which after dividing by 3 on both sides simplifies to w(w – 3) = 1,890.\nFrom this point on, different ways could be used to solve this equation. One could rewrite this quadratic equation in the standard form and use the quadratic formula to solve it. Another approach would be to look among integer factors of 1,890 and try to find two that differ from each other by 3 and whose product is 1,890. The prime factorization of 1,890 (2·3³·5·7) can help with this. Two factors that satisfy the conditions above are 42 and 45 (note that 42 = 2·3·7 and 45 = 3²·5). The numbers –45 and –42 also satisfy the above conditions (w = –42), but since w represents the width of Janice's garden, the negative values of w can be rejected. Thus w = 45 feet, and so the length of the garden must be 3(45) – 9 = 126 feet. Therefore, the perimeter of Janice's garden is 2(45 + 126) = 2(171) = 342 feet.",

                    "Rationale": "Since the vertex of the graph of the quadratic function is at (4, 19), the equation of the parabola is of the form y = a(x – 4)² + 19. It is also given that the parabola passes through point (0, 3). This means that 3 = a(0 – 4)² + 19, and so a = –1. So the graph of the parabola is y = –(x – 4)² + 19.\nSince the line passes through the points (0, –9) and (2, –1), one can calculate the slope of the line ((-1 - (-9))/(2 - 0) = 4) that passes through these points and write the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form as y = 4x – 9.\nThe coordinates of the intersection points of the line and the parabola satisfy both the equation of the parabola and the equation of the line. Therefore, these coordinates are the solutions to the following system of  equations: {y = 4x − 9; y = −(x − 4)² + 19}\nSubstituting 4x – 9 for y into the second equation gives 4x – 9 = –(x – 4)² + 19, which is equivalent to x² – 4x – 12 = 0. After factoring, this equation can be rewritten as (x – 6)(x + 2) = 0, and so x = 6 or x = –2. Since point (v, w) is on the right side of the y-axis, it follows that v cannot be –2. Therefore, v = 6.",

Since there are 24 sections that will be studied by 78 students, it follows that x + y = 24 and 2x + 4y = 78. Solving this system gives x = 9 and y = 15. Therefore, 9 of the sections will be studied by a group of 2 students.\n\nAlternatively, if all 24 sections were studied by a group of 4 students, then the total number of students required would be 24 × 4 = 96. Since the actual number of students is 78, the difference 96 – 78 = 18 represents the number of “missing” students, and each pair of these “missing” students represents one of the sections that will be studied by 2 students. Hence, the number of sections that will be studied by 2 students is equal to the number of pairs that 18 students can form, which is 18/2 = 9.",
