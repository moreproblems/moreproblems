                    "Rationale": "An equation representing the height above ground h, in meters, of a softball t seconds after it is launched by a machine from ground level can be written in the form h = –a(t – b)² + c, where a, b, and c are positive constants. In this equation, b represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of c meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of 51.84 meters above the ground at 1.8 seconds; therefore, b = 1.8 and c = 51.84. Substituting 1.8 for b and 51.84 for c in the equation h = –a(t – b)² + c yields h = –a(t – 1.8)² + 51.84. It's also given that this softball hits the ground at 3.6 seconds; therefore, h = 0 when t = 3.6. Substituting 0 for h and 3.6 for t in the equation h = –a(t – 1.8)² + 51.84 yields 0 = –a(3.6 - 1.8)² + 51.84, which is equivalent to 0 = –a(1.8)² + 51.84, or 0 = -3.24a + 51.84. Adding 3.24a to both sides of this equation yields 3.24a = 51.84. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3.24 yields a = 16. Substituting 16 for a in the equation h = –a(t – 1.8)² + 51.84 yields h = –16(t – 1.8)² + 51.84. Therefore, h = –16(t – 1.8)² + 51.84 represents the height above ground h, in meters, of this softball t seconds after it is launched.",

It follows that angle B is congruent to angle D and angle C is congruent to angle C. By the angle-angle similarity postulate, triangle ABC is similar to triangle BDC. Since triangles ABC and BDC are similar, it follows that AC/AB = BC/BD. It's also given that the length of AB is 15 and the length of AC is 23 greater than the length of AB. Therefore, the length of AC is 15 + 23, or 38. Substituting 15 for AB and 38 for AC in the equation AC/AB = BC/BD yields 38/15 = BC/BD. Therefore, the value of BC/BD is 38/15.",
