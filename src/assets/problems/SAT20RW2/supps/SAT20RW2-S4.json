        ["1", "\tAccording to a 2014 report from the Society for Human Resource Management, 54 percent of surveyed companies provide tuition assistance to employees pursuing an undergraduate degree, and 50 percent do so for employees working toward a graduate degree. [L1] [Despite these findings,] more companies should consider helping employees pay for education because doing so helps [L2] [increase customer satisfaction] and improve the quality of the companies' business."],
        ["2", "\tTuition-reimbursement programs signal that employers offer their [L3] [workers' opportunities] for personal and professional development. According to professor of management Peter Cappelli, such opportunities are appealing to highly motivated and disciplined individuals and may attract applicants with these desirable qualities. Many in the business community concur. Explaining his company's decision to expand its tuition-assistance program, John Fox, the director of dealer training at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the United States, [L4] [who stressed] the importance of drawing skilled employees to Fiat Chrysler's car dealerships: “This is a benefit that can surely bring top talent to our dealers,” he said."],
        ["3", "\tPaying for tuition also helps businesses retain [L5] [employees. Retaining employees] is important not only because it ensures a skilled and experienced workforce but also because it mitigates the considerable costs of finding, hiring, and training new workers. Employees whose tuition is reimbursed often stay with their employer even after they complete their [L6] [degrees. Because] their new qualifications give them opportunities for advancement within the company. The career of Valerie Lincoln, an employee at the aerospace company United Technologies Corporation [L7] [(UTC)] is a significant success story for her company's tuition‑reimbursement program. In eight years at UTC, Lincoln earned associate and bachelor's degrees in business and advanced from an administrative assistant position to an accounting associate position. This allowed UTC to retain an employee with a [L8] [deep] knowledge of her industry and years of valuable experience."],
        ["4", "\tTuition reimbursement can be expensive, and many companies would find it impractical to pay for multiple degrees for all employees. Businesses have succeeded in [L9] [minimizing and keeping down costs] and ensuring the relevance of employees' coursework by offering fixed amounts of reimbursement each year and stipulating which subjects workers can study. Even with these methods, tuition reimbursement may not be appropriate in all cases, especially if classes are likely [L10] [to divert] employees' time and energy from their jobs."]
