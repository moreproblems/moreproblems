A scale factor with the origin (point where the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical) on a coordinate grid intersect (cross); also, the point represented by the ordered pair (0, 0)) as the center of dilation means that each point on the dilated figure will be a certain number of times as far from the origin as it was on the original figure. Since the location of vertex Q was originally represented at (6, 2), and the location of the corresponding vertex (vertex Q′) on the dilated figure is at (21, 7), the scale factor of the dilation can be determined by dividing the value of each corresponding coordinate of vertex Q′ by the value of each corresponding coordinate of vertex Q (21 ÷ 6 = 7/2 and 7 ÷ 2 = 7/2), so the rule (x, y) ⇒ (7x, 7y) represents the dilation.",

Then the student could have determined that the graph appears to pass through the points located at (0, 0) and (6, 30) and the slope between these points is represented by the equation m = (30 − 0)/(6 − 0) = 30/6 = 5/1, which is equal to 5. This is an efficient way to solve the problem; however, other methods could be used to solve the problem correctly.",
