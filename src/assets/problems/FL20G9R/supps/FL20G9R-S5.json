        "In 1973, some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) banned petroleum exports to the United States and introduced cuts in oil production. As the price of oil rose sharply in 1973, President Richard Nixon addressed the American people to explain the steps the people and the government would take to deal with the emerging energy crisis.",
        "\nPresident Nixon spoke to the American people about the energy crisis multiple times during this period. This speech was made several weeks later."

        ["1", "\tGood afternoon:"],
        ["2", "\tTen weeks ago, I reported to the Nation on the energy crisis. I asked all Americans to accept some sacrifices in comfort and convenience so that no American would have to suffer real hardship."],
        ["3", "\tToday, I want to report to you on our progress and answer the basic questions that many Americans have asked about this crisis."],
        ["4", "\tOn the positive side, I am glad to be able to report that we are making solid progress in facing up to this challenge. There are several reasons for this:"],
        ["5", "\tFar more important than anything else is what every American has done voluntarily. It is your response—the actions you take to save energy on a personal, voluntary, day-in, day-out basis—that is now the single most important reason for our success so far."],
        ["6", "\tFor the past 7 weeks, we have observed “gasless Sundays” across the country. Your cooperation with this program helped to make it possible for me to announce today that during the month of December, the total consumption of gasoline in the United States was nearly 9 percent below expectations."],
        ["7", "\tAmericans are also responding to the call for lower temperatures at home and at work. A recent report from New England shows that 19,000 homes surveyed there have reduced heating oil consumption by more than 16 percent under last year, and that is after making adjustments for warmer weather."],
        ["8", "\tUtilities are reporting that the consumption of natural gas across the country has been reduced by approximately 6 percent over last year, while the consumption of electricity—in homes, offices, factories, and elsewhere—is down by about 10 percent."],
        ["9", "\tBeyond the progress we have made because of voluntary conservation, we have also been fortunate because the weather in the last quarter of 1973 was warmer than usual, so we did not consume so much for fuel for heating as we expected. Even though the oil embargo continues in the Middle East, we have also received some oil we did not expect at the time the embargo was imposed."],
        ["10", "\tFinally, let me tell you what your Government has been doing to meet this crisis."],
        ["11", "\tA fuel allocation program has been set up so that no area of the Nation is being subjected to undue hardship. We have begun the process of converting oil-burning utilities to the use of coal wherever possible, freeing some 200,000 barrels of oil a day for use in other areas."],
        ["12", "\tAt my request, laws governing energy conservation, such as year-round daylight savings time, have been enacted by the Congress and are now in effect. Teams of Federal inspectors have been sent to investigate fuel prices at gasoline stations and truck stops. Where price gouging is discovered, it is being stopped."],
        ["13", "\tWithin the Government, where we have a special obligation to set an example, I first directed that energy consumption be cut by at least 7 percent. That goal has now been met, and it has been exceeded. Consumption of energy by the Federal Government has been cut by more than 20 percent under anticipated demands."],
        ["14", "\tThese are just some of the steps we have taken to meet the problem head-on, and you can expect more in the future."],
        ["15", "\tNothing which the Federal Government might do could be successful, however, without the full cooperation of the American people. It is your sacrifice that is making the difference. You deserve the credit."],
        ["", "****"],
        ["16", "\tAmerica is a rich, a strong, and a good country. We must set for ourselves this goal: We must never again be caught in a foreign-made crisis where the United States is dependent on any other country, friendly or unfriendly, for the energy we need to produce our jobs, to heat our homes, to furnish our transportation for wherever we want to go."],
        ["17", "\tLate last year, I announced the beginning of Project Independence, a full-scale effort to provide the capacity to meet American energy needs with American energy resources by 1980. As an important part of that project, the head of the Federal Energy Office, William Simon, will mount a major effort this year to accelerate the development of new energy supplies for the future."],
        ["18", "\tMost of the money and the work for Project Independence must come from private enterprise. But the Federal Government also has a vital role to play. It must be a catalyst for industrial initiative. It must clear away the red tape that lies in the way of expanding our supplies, and it must provide the seed money for research and development."],
        ["19", "\tMany of these Federal responsibilities can only be met with new legislation. That is why, over the next few weeks, I shall submit to the Congress a broad legislative package of energy initiatives and urge it to place these requests at the very top of the Congressional agenda for 1974. If we are to be successful in dealing with our long-term energy needs, the Congress must play its part, and I believe that the Congress, after returning from their districts over the Christmas holidays, will agree that the people want them to play their part along with the Administration."],
        ["20", "\tThe burden of energy conservation, of cutbacks and inconvenience, of occasional discomfort, continued concern is not, I can assure you, an artificial one. It is real. During the Second World War, Winston Churchill was once asked why England was fighting Hitler. He answered, “If we stop, you will find out.”"],
        ["21", "\tIf we should choose to believe that our efforts in fighting the energy crisis are unnecessary, if we permit ourselves to slacken our efforts and slide back into the wasteful consumption of energy, then the full force of the energy crisis will be brought home to America in a most devastating fashion, and there will be no longer any question in anyone’s mind about the reality of the crisis."],
        ["22", "\tThe distance between the winter of 1974 and the springtime of energy independence for the United States remains great. We must proceed with confidence in our ability to do the job. Far more importantly, we must act now, as one people, to do the job that must be done."]
