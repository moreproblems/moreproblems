To my mother, good food meant fresh ingredients; to my father, good food meant that there was a lot of it; a͟n͟d͟ ͟m͟y͟ ͟g͟r͟a͟n͟d͟m͟o͟t͟h͟e͟r͟ ͟t͟h͟o͟u͟g͟h͟t good food meant that you had taken the time to do all of the little details yourself.

There was nothing g͟l͟a͟m͟o͟r͟u͟s about the work, but the transformation of those simple ingredients seemed like magic."]
