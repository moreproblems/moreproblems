To my mother, good food meant fresh ingredients; to my father, good food meant that there was a lot of it; a͟n͟d͟ ͟m͟y͟ ͟g͟r͟a͟n͟d͟m͟o͟t͟h͟e͟r͟ ͟t͟h͟o͟u͟g͟h͟t good food meant that you had taken the time to do all of the little details yourself. I never argued with my parents about it, but secretly I thought that my grandmother was right, and that's why I always enjoyed helping her make bread."],

The starter was a glob taken from a bowl of fermenting dough that my grandmother always had ready. There was nothing g͟l͟a͟m͟o͟r͟u͟s about the work, but the transformation of those simple ingredients seemed like magic."]
