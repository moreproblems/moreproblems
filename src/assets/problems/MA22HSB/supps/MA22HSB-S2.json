        [" ", "In North America, the populations of six species of bats have decreased by up to 99% since 2006. These decreases in population sizes are largely due to white-nose syndrome (WNS). WNS is caused by a fungus that infects the skin on bats’ wings, ears, and noses. The infected skin, which often appears white, loses more water than healthy, normal skin."],
        [" ", "One species of bat affected by WNS is the little brown bat. This bat has a very small mass (about 14 g) and hunts for flying insects at night. Females typically give birth to one offspring per year."],
        [" ", "In preparation for winter, little brown bats eat more insects to build up fat reserves in their bodies. In winter, they hibernate, which decreases body temperature, breathing rate, and metabolic rate. The bats do not eat while they are hibernating."],
        [" ", "Little brown bats typically wake up only for brief periods of time during hibernation. When a bat does wake up, its body temperature increases as it flies around."],
        [" ", "WNS affects the number of times that a bat wakes up during hibernation. Healthy bats wake up once every 20 days, and about 80% survive hibernation. Bats infected with WNS wake up once every 9 days, and only about 4% survive hibernation."],
