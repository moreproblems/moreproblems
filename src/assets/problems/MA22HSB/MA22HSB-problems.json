            "An invasive insect called the Asian longhorned beetle is threatening some forests in the United States. The beetle attacks and kills hardwood trees, including maple, elm, ash, poplar, willow, birch, and horse chestnut. The beetle larvae feed on the tissues inside the trees. As a result, the flow of water and nutrients in the trees is disrupted and the trees die. As adults, the beetles move to the outside of the trees."
