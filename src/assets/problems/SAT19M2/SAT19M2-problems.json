It's given that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: the inequality 120a + 100b ≤ 1,100 represents this situation. It's also given that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages: the inequality a + b ≥ 10 represents this situation. Values of a and b that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and 100-pound packages the helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, a, in the helicopter, the number of 100-pound packages, b, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing b in terms of a in the second inequality yields b ≥ 10 − a, so the minimum value of b is equal to 10 − a. Substituting 10 − a for b in the first inequality results in 120a + 100(10 − a) ≤ 1,100. Using the distributive property to rewrite this inequality yields 120a + 1,000 − 100a ≤ 1,100, or 20a + 1,000 ≤ 1,100. Subtracting 1,000 from both sides of this inequality yields 20a ≤ 100. Dividing both sides of this inequality by 20 results in a ≤ 5. This means that the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5.",

Let c be the number of cups of Crunchy Grain cereal and s be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal. The expression 280c represents the number of calories in c cups of Crunchy Grain cereal, and 240s represents the number of calories in s cups of Super Grain cereal. The equation 280c + 240s = 270 gives the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture. Since c + s = 1 cup, c = 1 − s. Substituting 1 − s for c in the equation 280c + 240s = 270 yields 280(1 − s) + 240s = 270, or 280 − 280s + 240s = 270. Simplifying this equation yields 280 − 40s = 270.

Therefore, the value of h is the mean of the x-coordinates of the circle's two x-intercepts: h = (20 + 4)/2 = 12. The radius of the circle is given as 10, so the point (h, k) must be a distance of 10 units from any point on the circle. The equation of any circle can be written as (x − h)² + (y − k)² = r², where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is the length of the radius of the circle. Substituting 12 for h and 10 for r into this equation gives (x − 12)² + (y − k)² = 10². Substituting the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a point on the circle, (4, 0), gives (4 − 12)² + (0 − k)² = 10², or 64 + k² = 100. Subtracting 64 from both sides of this equation yields k² = 36.

The total number of people who are rhesus negative in the group is 7 + 2 + 1 + x, and there are 2 people who are rhesus negative with blood type B. Therefore, 2/(7 + 2 + 1 + x) = 1/9. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of the equation yields 2/(10 + x) = 1/9. Multipl ying both sides of this equation by 9 yields 18/(10 + x) = 1, and multiplying both sides of this equation by (10 + x) yields 18 = 10 + x. Subtracting 10 from both sides of this equation yields 8 = x.",

Each of the equations can be written in slope-intercept form, or y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the line's y-intercept. Subtracting 3x/4 from both sides of 3x/4 − y/2 = 12 yields −y/2 = −3x/4 + 12. Dividing both sides of this equation by −1/2 yields y = (−3/4)/(−/12)x + 12/(−1/2), or y = 3x/2 − 24. Therefore, the slope of the line represented by the first equation in the system is 3/2. The second equation in the system can be put into slope-intercept form by first subtracting ax from both sides of ax − by = 9, then dividing both sides of the equation by −b, which yields y = ax/b − 9/b. Therefore, the slope of the line represented by the second equation in the system is a/b. Parallel lines have equal slopes. Therefore, a/b = 3/2.",
