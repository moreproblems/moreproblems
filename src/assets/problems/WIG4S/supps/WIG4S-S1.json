        [" ", "It is difficult to see underwater where it is dark. Some ocean animals, such as dolphins, use sounds to help them understand their water environment. Dolphins produce high-pitched sounds. These sound waves travel through the water until they bump into an object. Then, the sound waves bounce off the object. The echoes of the sound waves return to the dolphin—specifically to the dolphin’s jaw. The sounds travel through the dolphin’s jaw to its inner ear, where the sounds are translated into nerve impulses that travel to the brain. The way dolphins “see” with sounds is called echolocation."],

        [" ", "From echoing sound waves, dolphins can learn a lot about an object: its shape, its size, its distance from the dolphin, and whether it is moving toward or away from the dolphin. Dolphins use echolocation to find their way around, to find prey, and to communicate with each other."],
        [" ", "Scientists realized that the way dolphins can gather information from sounds could be used for human-made technology. Sonar is one example of this type of technology. Sonar is used by submarines and ships to find their way underwater and locate objects. Similar to echolocation, sonar sends out sound waves and interprets the echoing waves."]
